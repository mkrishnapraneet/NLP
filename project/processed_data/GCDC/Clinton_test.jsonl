{"text_id": "C05760125_1", "text": "Madame Secretary:\n\nThank you for reaching out to Secretary Solis and convincing her to join the Verification Commission. She and Ricardo Lagos will make for a very high profile and effective international component of the Commission.\n\nWe will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point, it appears we have a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C., stop in Miami to pick up Ricardo Lagos, and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubt about our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.\n\nYou should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates its America's column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday, Representative Connie Mack did the same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough, stalwart guy. He and his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost. Finally, we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps. We will keep you up to date on these steps and identify further opportunities for your engagement.\n\nI want to thank you for your leadership and support during this long crisis. Your willingness to engage at key moments and take risks at the right time have propelled us much further than anyone expected. Your diplomacy prevented a debilitating civil conflict in Honduras that would have destabilized Central America and undermined two decades of our efforts. We now have a big opportunity in front of us, and for that we are grateful to you.

Had just talked to Lavrov, who was constructive on UNSCR, supportive of vote on Monday and raising relatively minor textual concerns. Lay did not object to ICC reference. Hague trying to reach S Af FM later today.\n\nHague and Ricketts agreed that UN ought to have central organizing role on post-Qadhafi efforts in Libya. Want to coordinate closely with us.\n\nOn wider regional issues, Hague and Ricketts positive on prospects for Tunisia and Egypt. They're only just beginning to think about broader strategy, but Ricketts agreed that changes unfolding across region are as big challenge for TransAtlantic partnership as end of Cold War was 20 yrs ago. Requires big ideas on support for pol institution building, economic modernization (esp trade liberalization), and peace process.\n\nRicketts said Cameron had spoken with Merkel this am, before Merkel's planned call to President.

{"text_id": "C05793399_3", "text": "Dear Cheryl,\n\nYou may recall that we met late last year when Secretary Clinton received Bernard Schwartz and me to discuss our proposal to raise a significant amount of private funds (without her involvement) to enable Baruch College to re-name and expand its School of Public Affairs as the \"Hillary Rodham Clinton School of Public and International Affairs\" and to establish, in parallel, the \"Hillary Rodham Clinton Library\" to house her correspondence as First Lady, Senator and Secretary of State. When we concluded the meeting, Secretary Clinton indicated that she was\n\nintrigued by the proposal, but that it was premature to make a decision, given that she had not yet decided about her post-government plans.\n\nBernard and I responded that we fully understood this point and that we were prepared to be patient while her thinking evolved. During this time, we have refrained (and will continue to refrain) from any fundraising efforts or any public discussion of the idea. We are, in fact, eager to coordinate closely (and quietly) with you and the Secretary's other key staff as her thinking and planning evolves over the coming months. At the same time, I can report that Bernard and I have privately discussed the matter with the CUNY Chancellor, Matthew Goldstein, who is enthusiastically supportive of the idea and prepared to be helpful in a variety of ways.\n\nAt this point, I am seeking only to gain assurance that the proposal continues to be under active consideration by Secretary Clinton, and that we might be able to engage with you and/or Huma Abedin at an appropriate point in the coming months to discuss the details and our plans for implementation.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMitch Wallerstein\n\nMitchel B.

He also envisioned (and Senate Finance is assuming) state based exchanges so that there would be 50 state exchanges, instead of one national exchange. However, and this is all hush, hush, Senate Finance is considering a cost-based trigger; so if insurance premiums go up more than x%, a public plan would be triggered as a break on costs. I came up with the cost trigger versus the market consolidation trigger, because that trigger will be hard for the insurers to avoid, if set properly. And of course, they just promised savings, so it can hold them accountable. (But to be clear, I am pushing hard for the public plan; I just came up with that idea to strengthen the other side.) Of course, all of this is super secret. I think we could have a national public plan that is operating in several states where the trigger goes off. It will be tricky but it's doable. And it could be combined with a state option, so that if it's lowering costs, states will want to do it to give their citizens a lower cost choice.\n\nBut look, we were hoping to have a trigger in the end game, and now are dealing with it now, which is a problem.", "label1": 2, "label2": 2, "label3": 2, "label": 2, "sentences": [["You", "may", "recall", "that", "in", "the", "Medicare", "Part", "D", ",", "there", "was", "a", "trigger", "such", "that", "if", "an", "area", "only", "had", "two", "plans", ",", "a", "public", "drug", "plan", "would", "be", "created", "."], ["It", "has", "never", "been", "triggered", "."], ["Wyden", "discussed", "a", "market", "consolidation", "trigger", "-", "a", "proposal", "that", "if", "there", "were", "three", "or", "fewer", "plans", "in", "an", "area", ",", "a", "public", "plan", "would", "be", "triggered", "."], ["He", "also", "envisioned", "(", "and", "Senate", "Finance", "is", "assuming", ")", "state", "based", "exchanges", "so", "that", "there", "would", "be", "50", "state", "exchanges", ",", "instead", "of", "one", "national", "exchange", "."], ["However", ",", "and", "this", "is", "all", "hush", ",", "hush", ",", "Senate", "Finance", "is", "considering", "a", "cost", "-", "based", "trigger", ";", "so", "if", "insurance", "premiums", "go", "up", "more", "than", "x%", ",", "a", "public", "plan", "would", "be", "triggered", "as", "a", "break", "on", "costs", "."], ["I", "came", "up", "with", "the", "cost", "trigger", "versus", "the", "market", "consolidation", "trigger", ",", "because", "that", "trigger", "will", "be", "hard", "for", "the", "insurers", "to", "avoid", ",", "if", "set", "properly", "."], ["And", "of", "course", ",", "they", "just", "promised", "savings", ",", "so", "it", "can", "hold", "them", "accountable", "."], ["(", "But", "to", "be", "clear", ",", "I", "am", "pushing", "hard", "for", "the", "public", "plan", ";", "I", "just", "came", "up", "with", "that", "idea", "to", "strengthen", "the", "other", "side", ".", ")"], ["Of", "course", ",", "all", "of", "this", "is", "super", "secret", "."], ["I", "think", "we", "could", "have", "a", "national", "public", "plan", "that", "is", "operating", "in", "several", "states", "where", "the", "trigger", "goes", "off", "."], ["It", "will", "be", "tricky", "but", "it", "'s", "doable", "."], ["And", "it", "could", "be", "combined", "with", "a", "state", "option", ",", "so", "that", "if", "it", "'s", "lowering", "costs", ",", "states", "will", "want", "to", "do", "it", "to", "give", "their", "citizens", "a", "lower", "cost", "choice", "."], ["But", "look", ",", "we", "were", "hoping", "to", "have", "a", "trigger", "in", "the", "end", "game", ",", "and", "now", "are", "dealing", "with", "it", "now", ",", "which", "is", "a", "problem", "."]], "facts": [[["area", "had", "QUANT_O_1 plans"], ["public drug plan", "trigger be created"], ["trigger", "public drug plan be created"]], [["It", "has been triggered"]], [["Wyden", "discussed", "market consolidation trigger"], ["QUANT_S_1 plans in area", "there were"], ["fewer plans in area", "there were"], ["public plan", "be triggered"]], [["He", "envisioned", "also"], ["He", "envisioned"], ["Senate Finance", "is assuming state based exchanges so that", "there would be QUANT_O_1 state exchanges"], ["Senate Finance", "is assuming state based exchanges", "QUANT_O_1 national exchange"], ["Senate Finance", "is assuming", "state based exchanges"]], [["this", "is Senate Finance is considering", "hush cost-based trigger"], ["Senate Finance", "this is is considering", "hush cost-based trigger"], ["public plan", "be triggered as break on", "costs"]], [["I", "came up with", "cost trigger"], ["I", "came up with", "market consolidation trigger"], ["insurers", "to avoid if", "set properly"]], [["they", "promised savings of", "course"], ["they", "promised", "savings"], ["it", "hold them", "accountable"], ["it", "hold", "them"]], [["I", "am pushing hard to be", "clear"], ["I", "am pushing hard for", "public plan"], ["I", "am pushing", "hard"], ["I", "came up just with", "idea to strengthen other side"], ["I", "came up with", "idea to strengthen other side"], ["idea", "be strengthen", "other side"]], [["QUANT_S_1 of this", "is super secret Of", "course"], ["QUANT_S_1 of this", "is", "super secret"]], [["we", "have", "national public plan"], ["national public plan", "is operating in", "QUANT_O_1 states"], ["trigger", "goes off", "QUANT_O_1 states"]], [["It", "be", "tricky"], ["it", "'s", "doable"]], [["it", "be combined with", "state option"], ["it", "'s lowering", "costs"], ["states", "want to do", "it to give citizens lower cost choice"], ["their", "has", "citizens"]], [["we", "were hoping to have trigger in", "end game"], ["we", "were hoping to have", "trigger"], ["we", "are dealing with", "it"], ["which", "is", "problem"]]]}

In that you are not alone. Blackberry has taken a lot of grief over it from users and critics.

Over the next year, because of the need, SPI is launching a number of initiatives to treat Iraq and Afghanistan veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress and at risk for suicide.\n\nToday, we now lose more of our young men and women in uniform to suicide than to combat.

We lose a service member to suicide approximately every 36 hours. In July, the Army alone lost 33 active and reserve soldiers.

As more American troops return home and transition from war zones, this issue will continue to require our urgent attention.\n\nI'm currently hiring 2 full time staff members- a COO who must have non-profit financial management training and experience and a Director of Events and Donor relations.

The Internet tends to amplify and empower voices at the edges and is a difficult space for moderation and to achieve compromise. We've seen it in our own (American) politics where it has strengthened the edges, the net roots on the left and the tea party on the right, while punishing those trying to find common ground as accommodationist.

We work closely with colleagues in Kabul, NATO and elsewhere. We get decent support from Washington and other field elements, although sometimes we struggle to get basic information from our colleagues, such as total number of troops involved in Operation Moshtarak.\n\nOne challenge for us is that we are tightly bound here in the public mind to HMG on this issue.

The suspension lasts until the SARG fully implements the AL initiative. (More below on this date.)\n\n-- agreement that AL SecGen al-Araby would work on plans to protect civilians, including by looking at how to cooperate with Arab and international human rights groups (again, more below). He is expected to present ideas for the 11/16 meeting in Rabat.\n\n-- call on Arab states to withdraw ambassadors from Damascus, although with a caveat that such decisions are the sovereign right of each state.\n\nAccording to what I heard, the sanctions language was more or less a place holder reference.

{"text_id": "C05761833_1", "text": "I talked with Mary Beth Sheridan. This is actually a pretty good story. The thrust of the piece is that there is a great deal of concern about growing Iranian influence in Latin America \u2014 talk of investments, projects and so forth \u2014 but so far very little has actually appeared. In other words, the Iranians are talking a good game but not delivering. It is within this context that Mary Beth picked up on the comment by the Secretary of this large embassy in Manangua that It turns out is not under construction, at least not yet.\n\nOn the record, I said that the Secretary picked this up from one of her counterparts from the region during a bilateral.

{"text_id": "C05788450_0", "text": "You had asked about the Quilliam foundation. Here is some basic background:.\n\nThe Quilliam Foundation is a London-based think tank that tries to nuance government approaches to Muslims and to separate Islam and Islamism, which it sees as a root cause of terror. Quilliam seeks to encourage a Western version of Islam, on the premise that there are more Muslims living in the Western world than the Middle East.\n\nSo far they have many focused on publications, reports, and media hits. Critics point out that while certain organizations, like Active Change, have positively engaged British Muslim communities, Quilliam has focused more on media efforts that spotlight the problem of extremism rather than actually countering it.

{"text_id": "C05782458_1", "text": "Jake, I hope this helps. I consulted with USUN and AF to fact check this:\n\nThe United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has given the UN Mission in Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI) a very clear chapter 7 mandate. UNSC Resolution 1933 (June 2010) is the most recent confirmation of this. UNOCI's mandate includes the responsibility to \"protect civilians...within its capabilities and...in high risk areas of deployment,\" monitor the arms embargo, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance, and other responsibilities. Last week, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), in which Nigeria is a driving force, released a communiqu\u00e9 that called on the UNSC to strengthen UNOCI's mandate. However, our view and the view of the UK and France is that the UNSC has already given UNOCI the strongest mandate possible. It's UNOCI's rules of engagement (ROE), which are drafted by the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operates (DPKO), and not the Mission's UNSC mandate that should be strengthened and clarified. We're working in New York to push the DPKO to clarify UNOCI's ROE.\n\nAF and USUN's view is that UNOCI should do a better job in carrying out the civilian protection component of its mandate. USUN is working with the French to make this clear in the current UNSC resolution that is being negotiated in New York today, including inserting language that \"stresses [the UNSC's] full support given to UNOCI to use all necessary means to carry out its mandate to protect civilians.\" Nigeria, as a non-permanent member of the UNSC, is an active part of these discussions. To help enable UNOCI, we are working with other donors to train and equip new troop contributors to bring UNOCI's force level from its current deployment of approximately 9,000 soldiers to the

{"text_id": "C05785296_0", "text": "Dear Cheryl,\n\nI just wanted to close the loop with you and thank you for facilitating my invitation to be a guest at last night's SED dinner. It was an enjoyable and productive evening and frankly had a positive feel to it despite the current issues of the day between the US and China. Both Secretary Clinton and Secretary Geithner gave excellent remarks, both in tone and substance.

The vote to invoke cloture will double as a vote on the motion to proceed, allowing senators to head home for Thanksgiving recess following the 8 p.m. vote.\n\nIf cloture is invoked, Reid would immediately call up his bill as a substitute amendment to a House measure that will serve as the shell for the motion to proceed vote. Senator Coburn had threatened to require the clerk to read the 2,000page bill following the vote on the motion to proceed, but Reid will call up the bill by number only, which prevents a reading.\n\nWhether Reid has the votes to break the filibuster Saturday hangs on three Democrats: Senators Lincoln, Landrieu, and Ben Nelson. All three say they are undecided, but appear to indicate they are leaning toward voting in favor of cloture.\n\nReportedly Landrieu has been using her leverage to attempt to change the bill as it moves forward and won a particularly sweet deal that could bring billions to Louisiana. Following 2005's Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana saw an increase in per capita income, which led to a significant drop in federal Medicaid funding. Reid included language in the bill that will increase funding by 50 percent of the total decrease.\n\nYou will recall that Senator Snowe was the only Republican to vote in favor of the Finance bill, but said she has too many concerns with Reid's version to support the cloture vote Saturday.\n\nEarlier this week, the CBO scored the Reid bill.

The only question seems to be whether those elections take place next month or later this fall.

Voters yesterday were clearly in the mood to punish the two main parties and reject \"politics as usual,\" but they did so either by choosing the extremes - the radical left, SYRIZA, and the neo-fascist Golden Dawn - or by abstaining (some also voted for minor parties that will not meet the threshold for entry into Parliament). The concern with holding elections again in just a month is that there will not be sufficient time for new, more moderate forces to emerge that will give people a clear and effective alternative to the extremes.\n\nIn the meantime, the Governor of the Central Bank has told me that there has thus far been no massive withdrawals of deposits from the banks, though he remains concerned that something could still trigger that.

{"text_id": "C05767719_2", "text": "Dave, According to the Agricultural Agreement between Israel and the US from 2004 (ATAP), carp is not exempted from custom duties. Last December the Israeli customs realized that according to the tariff list their is no customs on the importation of carp to Israel. That was amended. A few weeks ago a representative of the relevant company in Illinois contacted our trade mission to inquire about the new customs tariff and was told that it would apply to all the carp his company will send to Israel. Therefore it should not have been a surprise to the company this new customs tariff.

As you know, and very much thanks to the help again of HRC, we hope to be able to move forward with the final phase of the political process in the Autumn.

The session would explore the steps for the peace and political process in NI and obviously a session could have wider application into say the Middle East peace and political process.

One of the principles is Craig Fant. Their operation is on the Gulf Coast. The agreement would be to provide meals to 120,000 folks a day for a year in Haiti. I did a good bit of due diligence thru the afternoon with contacts I have on the coast, in Jackson and in the Delta (the ag region) and these folks did a lot of the Katrina work and have the staging facilities in Gulfport to move their goods to Haiti... the facility, in fact, was built with Katrina money as part of the single largest FAA grant in history... this airport is used as the staging and departure area for troops going to Afghanistan... the cargo terminals and personnel are equipped and experienced in this type of work. Also, there has been a solid, transparent and deliberate effort by this company to work with and buy products from minority farmers in the Delta... I don't know your politics, etc. I don't know the details on your end, boss... I get so many requests each month wanting me to offer good words, etc. to you on behalf of some entity... most of the time it's all about the dollar signs I see in their eyes... I ignore them... but my discovery process of F & B Catering, their Katrina work, the confidence in their capacity, the use of post Katrina federally funded facilities and the commitment to minority farmers was all compelling... so I share!

{"text_id": "C05770612_0", "text": "Finally, I'm meeting with Robert Pear on Friday to pitch him on how so many of your ideas are in the health care bill and it is closest to your proposal. He is biting on the idea, though, of course, I can't guarantee anything. I've held out for him, but if he doesn't I can go to the Post or elsewhere. I have all I need on how the bill represents your campaign proposals and the like. The one question I wanted to ask you is about your idea on using FEHBP as a kind of a public option. I know you gave that to Rahm last August, and then mysteriously, it was in the Senate Finance package like a month later. None of us had ever discussed it in the policy process of the WH and I didn't hear of it in the Hill, so my assumption is that Rahm gave them your idea as a substitute for the public plan, which didn't have the votes. I know that was all top secret, but I'm wondering if I should give Robert some hint of this only because it was a linchpin to moving the bill. I would get him sniffing around on it, so he'd write it more as his own reporting discovery (hopefully). I know institutionally it was hard for Rahm to be pitching public plan substitutes. On the other hand, everything is leaking out now, including our super secret bill writing process in August. I can see the arguments on both sides of this, so wanted to check in on it.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else for this story that would be helpful.\n\nHope you're well.\n\nNeera", "label1": 2,

{"text_id": "C05784364_6", "text": "Ambassador Siddique:\n\nGreat speaking with you today.\n\nPer our conversation, below and attached is further background regarding the East-West Center itself and responsibility of Board Members.\n\nAs you know, the East-West Center, based in Honolulu, promotes better relations and understanding among the people and nations of the U.S., Asia, and the Pacific through cooperative study, research, and dialogue.\n\nThe 18 member board includes five members appointed by the Secretary, five appointed by the Governor of Hawaii, and five international members chosen by the Board itself. The Secretary's appointees serve for a three year term. The position does not require senate confirmation.\n\nThe Board meets twice per year in Honolulu, with several subcommittees on various initiatives.\n\nBelow is the link to the Center's website. I also attached a document sent to me by Dr. Morrison outlining responsibilities of Board members. http://www.eastwestcenter.orq/about-ewc/\n\nLet me know if there's any additional information I can provide you.\n\nMany thanks.
