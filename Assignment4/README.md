there are two python files, 
sst.py and nli.py

run the first one using the following command:
```
python3 sst.py
```

run the second one using the following command:
```
python3 nli.py
```

the models that have been trained are saved as .pt files in the same directory as the python files.

model.pt is the model trained on the SST dataset and nli_model.pt is the model trained for the multiNLI dataset.

the models can be loaded using the python files or the notebook files.
