<start> <start> <start> this was invitation enough . <end> <end> <end>
2.3829641689026766
<start> <start> <start> " why , my dear , you must know , mrs . long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england ; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr . morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week ." <end> <end> <end>

2.2552462100306796
<start> <start> <start> how can it affect them ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.343760105685572
<start> <start> <start> " my dear mr . bennet ," replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! <end> <end> <end>
2.547017457955697
<start> <start> <start> you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> nonsense , how can you talk so ! <end> <end> <end>
2.550071442221156
<start> <start> <start> but it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes ." <end> <end> <end>
2.9564671711532458
<start> <start> <start> " i see no occasion for that . <end> <end> <end>
2.3186431318546354
<start> <start> <start> you and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , mr . bingley might like you the best of the party ." <end> <end> <end>
2.386573721057941
<start> <start> <start> " my dear , you flatter me . <end> <end> <end>
2.334970194923199

2.5738827456446787
<start> <start> <start> " it is more than i engage for , i assure you ." <end> <end> <end>
2.48669604573843
<start> <start> <start> sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers . <end> <end> <end>
2.0533007477025524
<start> <start> <start> indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him , if you do not ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " you are over scrupulous surely . <end> <end> <end>
2.15854998420628
<start> <start> <start> i dare say mr . bingley will be very glad to see you ; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy ." <end> <end> <end>
2.333538479445472
<start> <start> <start> " i desire you will do no such thing . <end> <end> <end>
2.1847730667281273
<start> <start> <start> lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good humoured as lydia . <end> <end> <end>
2.3395776109498536
<start> <start> <start> but you are always giving _her_ the preference ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3612036945367563
<start> <start> <start> " they have none of them much to recommend them ," replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0184625369595017
<start> <start> <start> you take delight in vexing me . <end> <end> <end>
2.2160610033745276
<start> <start> <start> you have no compassion on my poor nerves ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " you mistake me , my dear . <end> <end> <end>
2.5914883572647964
<start> <start> <start> i have a high respect for your nerves . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , i will visit them all ." <end> <end> <end>
2.7757403754800314
<start> <start> <start> mr . bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . <end> <end> <end>
1.9939991351461692
<start> <start> <start> _her_ mind was less difficult to develope . <end> <end> <end>
2.225087497838069
<start> <start> <start> the business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news . <end> <end> <end>

2.2877904988078965
<start> <start> <start> mr . bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr . bingley . <end> <end> <end>
2.711396968199899
<start> <start> <start> he had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it . <end> <end> <end>
2.4210622751903608
<start> <start> <start> observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " i hope mr . bingley will like it lizzy ." <end> <end> <end>
2.462890189991809
<start> <start> <start> " we are not in a way to know _what_ mr . bingley likes ," said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit ." <end> <end> <end>
2.607975418804079
<start> <start> <start> " but you forget , mama ," said elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that mrs . long has promised to introduce him ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5167018960502427
<start> <start> <start> " i do not believe mrs . long will do any such thing . <end> <end> <end>
2.214489244672423
<start> <start> <start> she has two nieces of her own . <end> <end> <end>
2.5719336389065575
<start> <start> <start> she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion of her ." <end> <end> <end>
2.8735914009887367
<start> <start> <start> " no more have i ," said mr . bennet ; " and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you ." <end> <end> <end>
2.621959500804983
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters . <end> <end> <end>
2.1366454383240154
<start> <start> <start> " don ' t keep coughing so , kitty , for heaven ' s sake ! <end> <end> <end>

2.515371558675025
<start> <start> <start> " when is your next ball to be , lizzy ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.2621297152004605
<start> <start> <start> " then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce mr . bingley to _her_ ." <end> <end> <end>
2.9394701720940355
<start> <start> <start> " i honour your circumspection . <end> <end> <end>
2.1940997598640144
<start> <start> <start> a fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little . <end> <end> <end>
2.2557118229372484
<start> <start> <start> one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . <end> <end> <end>
2.2141666434081304
<start> <start> <start> but if _we_ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , mrs . long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , i will take it on myself ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2736504286183927
<start> <start> <start> the girls stared at their father . <end> <end> <end>
2.366152095289084
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet said only , " nonsense , nonsense !" <end> <end> <end>
2.1307644604568208
<start> <start> <start> " what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.197797645659354
<start> <start> <start> cried he . <end> <end> <end>
2.6437328661142505
<start> <start> <start> " do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? <end> <end> <end>
2.1731641037477405
<start> <start> <start> i cannot quite agree with you _there_ . <end> <end> <end>
2.1967013300046956
<start> <start> <start> what say you , mary ? <end> <end> <end>
2.536673298469858
<start> <start> <start> for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know , and read great books , and make extracts ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5874000067028122
<start> <start> <start> mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . <end> <end> <end>
2.334691342058005
<start> <start> <start> bingley ." <end> <end> <end>
2.9366790449415094
<start> <start> <start> " i am sick of mr . bingley ," cried his wife . <end> <end> <end>
2.785120863040516
<start> <start> <start> " i am sorry to hear _that_ ; but why did not you tell me so before ? <end> <end> <end>
2.2316377569843358
<start> <start> <start> if i had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on him . <end> <end> <end>
2.6023607418319776
<start> <start> <start> it is very unlucky ; but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3788348717543486
<start> <start> <start> the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of mrs . bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . <end> <end> <end>
2.396571716978623
<start> <start> <start> " how good it was in you , my dear mr . bennet ! <end> <end> <end>
3.038938259001398
<start> <start> <start> but i knew i should persuade you at last . <end> <end> <end>
2.2580804478396126
<start> <start> <start> i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . <end> <end> <end>
2.0124172541212686
<start> <start> <start> well , how pleased i am ! <end> <end> <end>
2.2995224723717187
<start> <start> <start> and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now ." <end> <end> <end>
2.72329959358858
<start> <start> <start> " now , kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse ," said mr . bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . <end> <end> <end>
2.8975856146105876
<start> <start> <start> " what an excellent father you have , girls ," said she , when the door was shut . <end> <end> <end>
2.346883374322798
<start> <start> <start> " i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . <end> <end> <end>
1.9457117169465732
<start> <start> <start> at our time of life , it is not so pleasant i can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing . <end> <end> <end>
2.480503433862819
<start> <start> <start> said lydia stoutly , " i am not afraid ; for though i _am_ the youngest , i ' m the tallest ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter iii . <end> <end> <end>
2.2877904988078965
<start> <start> <start> not all that mrs . bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr . bingley . <end> <end> <end>
2.800853901584843
<start> <start> <start> they attacked him in various ways ; with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second - hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas . <end> <end> <end>
2.0009278162292063
<start> <start> <start> her report was highly favourable . <end> <end> <end>
2.327867295085665
<start> <start> <start> sir william had been delighted with him . <end> <end> <end>
2.1881852003998925
<start> <start> <start> he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . <end> <end> <end>
2.3837781256786212
<start> <start> <start> nothing could be more delightful ! <end> <end> <end>
2.755852051889372
<start> <start> <start> to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of mr . bingley ' s heart were entertained . <end> <end> <end>
2.3005442936242595
<start> <start> <start> " if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield ," said mrs . bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for ." <end> <end> <end>
2.80338530339868
<start> <start> <start> in a few days mr . bingley returned mr . bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library . <end> <end> <end>
2.96941224480214
<start> <start> <start> he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . <end> <end> <end>
2.3708450339109133
<start> <start> <start> the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse . <end> <end> <end>
2.05773987195007
<start> <start> <start> an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had mrs . bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . <end> <end> <end>
2.008221669688287
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , & c . mrs . bennet was quite disconcerted . <end> <end> <end>
2.741759618637051
<start> <start> <start> she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be . <end> <end> <end>
2.3844085700931887
<start> <start> <start> lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that mr . bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . <end> <end> <end>
2.317048153230463
<start> <start> <start> the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin . <end> <end> <end>
1.9844423935142712
<start> <start> <start> and when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; mr . bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . <end> <end> <end>
2.118600885043171
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley was good looking and gentleman - like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . <end> <end> <end>
2.3298670637234467
<start> <start> <start> his sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion . <end> <end> <end>
2.3108072576662266
<start> <start> <start> his brother - in - law , mr . hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend mr . darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . <end> <end> <end>
2.3301441798265454
<start> <start> <start> the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr . bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield . <end> <end> <end>
2.0731526017691033
<start> <start> <start> such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . <end> <end> <end>
2.3197590425916284
<start> <start> <start> what a contrast between him and his friend ! <end> <end> <end>
2.366661704756482
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy danced only once with mrs . hurst and once with miss bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . <end> <end> <end>
2.5134212122590602
<start> <start> <start> his character was decided . <end> <end> <end>
2.471831363595654
<start> <start> <start> he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again . <end> <end> <end>
2.4969691944547128
<start> <start> <start> amongst the most violent against him was mrs . bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters . <end> <end> <end>
2.1755750968201335
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , mr . darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr . bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it . <end> <end> <end>
2.3823237569636873
<start> <start> <start> " come , darcy ," said he , " i must have you dance . <end> <end> <end>
2.838544170599369
<start> <start> <start> i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . <end> <end> <end>
2.0597512229415824
<start> <start> <start> you had much better dance ." <end> <end> <end>
2.530195628724747
<start> <start> <start> " i certainly shall not . <end> <end> <end>
2.3447569244856328
<start> <start> <start> at such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable . <end> <end> <end>
2.7742800805144454
<start> <start> <start> " i would not be so fastidious as you are ," cried bingley , " for a kingdom ! <end> <end> <end>
2.8137695480950837
<start> <start> <start> upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as i have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty ." <end> <end> <end>
2.422883425191327
<start> <start> <start> " _you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room ," said mr . darcy , looking at the eldest miss bennet . <end> <end> <end>
2.4806435326285268
<start> <start> <start> she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld ! <end> <end> <end>
2.268524929454532
<start> <start> <start> but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and i dare say , very agreeable . <end> <end> <end>
2.708302315248667
<start> <start> <start> do let me ask my partner to introduce you ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1462235040467528
<start> <start> <start> " which do you mean ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.4472459653795036
<start> <start> <start> you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0975490375485326
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley followed his advice . <end> <end> <end>
2.4352077728549157
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy walked off ; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him . <end> <end> <end>
2.2139750026562
<start> <start> <start> she told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous . <end> <end> <end>
2.118637296672711
<start> <start> <start> the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . <end> <end> <end>
2.1707564133766177
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party . <end> <end> <end>
2.1054017916659435
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters . <end> <end> <end>
2.7011934395079082
<start> <start> <start> jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way . <end> <end> <end>
2.5697962584354688
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth felt jane ' s pleasure . <end> <end> <end>
2.921731760310446
<start> <start> <start> mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . <end> <end> <end>
2.3242976641491744
<start> <start> <start> they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants . <end> <end> <end>
2.2968639157129083
<start> <start> <start> they found mr . bennet still up . <end> <end> <end>
2.992959896736111
<start> <start> <start> with a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . <end> <end> <end>
2.3079953831356326
<start> <start> <start> he had rather hoped that all his wife ' s views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear . <end> <end> <end>
2.3690883508288776
<start> <start> <start> jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . <end> <end> <end>
2.2330473701945515
<start> <start> <start> every body said how well she looked ; and mr . bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . <end> <end> <end>
2.2856568044918215
<start> <start> <start> only think of _that_ my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . <end> <end> <end>
2.463630993267051
<start> <start> <start> i was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance . <end> <end> <end>
2.606702701311232
<start> <start> <start> so , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . <end> <end> <end>
2.328384506982174
<start> <start> <start> then , the two third he danced with miss king , and the two fourth with maria lucas , and the two fifth with jane again , and the two sixth with lizzy , and the boulanger ----" " if he had had any compassion for _me_ ," cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much ! <end> <end> <end>
2.7913910195550113
<start> <start> <start> for god ' s sake , say no more of his partners . <end> <end> <end>
2.497274021205646
<start> <start> <start> that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance !" <end> <end> <end>
2.520695218976763
<start> <start> <start> my dear ," continued mrs . bennet , " i am quite delighted with him . <end> <end> <end>
3.1345500409533718
<start> <start> <start> he is so excessively handsome ! <end> <end> <end>
2.38017953572154
<start> <start> <start> and his sisters are charming women . <end> <end> <end>
2.5374747440182914
<start> <start> <start> i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses . <end> <end> <end>
2.231662459079991
<start> <start> <start> i dare say the lace upon mrs . hurst ' s gown ----" here she was interrupted again . <end> <end> <end>
2.073621063034827
<start> <start> <start> mr . bennet protested against any description of finery . <end> <end> <end>
2.148599078497386
<start> <start> <start> she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr . darcy . <end> <end> <end>
2.0248906008328733
<start> <start> <start> " but i can assure you ," she added , " that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . <end> <end> <end>
2.376617644119554
<start> <start> <start> so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him ! <end> <end> <end>
2.4012113636774686
<start> <start> <start> he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! <end> <end> <end>
2.4650897137435805
<start> <start> <start> not handsome enough to dance with ! <end> <end> <end>
2.4654266740560637
<start> <start> <start> i quite detest the man ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter iv . <end> <end> <end>
2.2893520976531194
<start> <start> <start> when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr . bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . <end> <end> <end>
2.456349556556773
<start> <start> <start> " he is just what a young man ought to be ," said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and i never saw such happy manners !-- so much ease , with such perfect good breeding !" <end> <end> <end>
2.482146589594452

2.3204149058491246
<start> <start> <start> " i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . <end> <end> <end>
2.172974033276226
<start> <start> <start> i did not expect such a compliment ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " did not you ? <end> <end> <end>
2.6512108843416464
<start> <start> <start> _i_ did for you . <end> <end> <end>
2.461872905651436
<start> <start> <start> but that is one great difference between us . <end> <end> <end>
2.2362641183154683
<start> <start> <start> compliments always take _you_ by surprise , and _me_ never . <end> <end> <end>
2.087516012647816
<start> <start> <start> what could be more natural than his asking you again ? <end> <end> <end>
2.342015992679082
<start> <start> <start> he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.3466313417694264
<start> <start> <start> no thanks to his gallantry for that . <end> <end> <end>
2.275425352045821
<start> <start> <start> well , he certainly is very agreeable , and i give you leave to like him . <end> <end> <end>
2.4366779299037455
<start> <start> <start> you have liked many a stupider person ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . <end> <end> <end>
2.24156101144176
<start> <start> <start> i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life ." <end> <end> <end>
2.325931485594671
<start> <start> <start> " i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ; but i always speak what i think ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5615885630892197

2.3618721017069024
<start> <start> <start> with _your_ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! <end> <end> <end>
2.5512511509312543
<start> <start> <start> affectation of candour is common enough ;-- one meets it every where . <end> <end> <end>
1.927980118543838
<start> <start> <start> but to be candid without ostentation or design -- to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad -- belongs to you alone . <end> <end> <end>
2.130962806071042
<start> <start> <start> and so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? <end> <end> <end>

2.483050901479129
<start> <start> <start> " certainly not ; at first . <end> <end> <end>
2.2960636266246186
<start> <start> <start> but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . <end> <end> <end>
2.151355298411534
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . <end> <end> <end>
2.2998617712078455
<start> <start> <start> they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . <end> <end> <end>
2.1211700578359753
<start> <start> <start> they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others . <end> <end> <end>
2.2887573493548286
<start> <start> <start> they were of a respectable family in the north of england ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . <end> <end> <end>
1.9138767534957013
<start> <start> <start> his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs . hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . <end> <end> <end>
2.2252713711179193
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house . <end> <end> <end>
2.352470492291057
<start> <start> <start> he did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . <end> <end> <end>
2.0482484580053266
<start> <start> <start> between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .-- bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . <end> <end> <end>
2.054984181183935
<start> <start> <start> on the strength of darcy ' s regard bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . <end> <end> <end>
2.440506152055105
<start> <start> <start> in understanding darcy was the superior . <end> <end> <end>
2.3266646781316522
<start> <start> <start> bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever . <end> <end> <end>
2.3344853662898113
<start> <start> <start> he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . <end> <end> <end>
2.2063763633145728
<start> <start> <start> in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . <end> <end> <end>
2.373058843562413
<start> <start> <start> bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence . <end> <end> <end>
2.068504619378878
<start> <start> <start> bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . <end> <end> <end>
2.3481001604728258
<start> <start> <start> darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . <end> <end> <end>
2.0937260946932565
<start> <start> <start> miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much . <end> <end> <end>
2.3486892879666326
<start> <start> <start> mrs . hurst and her sister allowed it to be so -- but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . <end> <end> <end>
2.4906059153612623
<start> <start> <start> miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose . <end> <end> <end>
2.2293418186644467
<start> <start> <start> chapter v . within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate . <end> <end> <end>
1.9606026354238189
<start> <start> <start> sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king , during his mayoralty . <end> <end> <end>
2.019962306052376
<start> <start> <start> the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . <end> <end> <end>
2.0373479676670754
<start> <start> <start> for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body . <end> <end> <end>
2.234171611357789
<start> <start> <start> by nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at st . james ' s had made him courteous . <end> <end> <end>

2.3639463633175075
<start> <start> <start> that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate . <end> <end> <end>

2.6110578102066695
<start> <start> <start> " pride ," observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing i believe . <end> <end> <end>
2.15003863879584
<start> <start> <start> by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> a person may be proud without being vain . <end> <end> <end>
2.2173973019112747
<start> <start> <start> pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us ." <end> <end> <end>
2.007093656462889
<start> <start> <start> " if i were as rich as mr . darcy ," cried a young lucas who came with his sisters , " i should not care how proud i was . <end> <end> <end>
2.560587708005597
<start> <start> <start> i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day ." <end> <end> <end>
1.814820954131731
<start> <start> <start> " then you would drink a great deal more than you ought ," said mrs . bennet ; " and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4525088817666187
<start> <start> <start> the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit . <end> <end> <end>
2.5359300256933532
<start> <start> <start> the visit was returned in due form . <end> <end> <end>
2.307947324974808
<start> <start> <start> miss bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs . hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ , was expressed towards the two eldest . <end> <end> <end>
2.1359501255455444
<start> <start> <start> by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration . <end> <end> <end>
2.312320898312592
<start> <start> <start> it was generally evident whenever they met , that he _did_ admire her ; and to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent . <end> <end> <end>
2.3073050129567214
<start> <start> <start> " it may perhaps be pleasant ," replied charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . <end> <end> <end>
2.47864301568107
<start> <start> <start> if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . <end> <end> <end>
2.3763029912866642
<start> <start> <start> we can all _begin_ freely -- a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . <end> <end> <end>
2.015821553233507
<start> <start> <start> in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels . <end> <end> <end>
1.9272766270458592
<start> <start> <start> bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3223163215919045
<start> <start> <start> " but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . <end> <end> <end>
2.473714922309421
<start> <start> <start> if _i_ can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4132092460690755

<start> <start> <start> " perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . <end> <end> <end>
2.44144724921356
<start> <start> <start> but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . <end> <end> <end>
2.2498913613747824
<start> <start> <start> jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . <end> <end> <end>
2.186886917289448

2.1827923105336744
<start> <start> <start> had she merely _dined_ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal ." <end> <end> <end>
2.225702082925866
<start> <start> <start> " yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt - un better than commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded ." <end> <end> <end>

2.794083025873613
<start> <start> <start> occupied in observing mr . bingley ' s attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . <end> <end> <end>
2.5256925675280097
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise . <end> <end> <end>
2.4637302216240946
<start> <start> <start> but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . <end> <end> <end>
2.0964949310950716
<start> <start> <start> to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . <end> <end> <end>
2.1505524319966973
<start> <start> <start> though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . <end> <end> <end>
2.1308924017340667
<start> <start> <start> of this she was perfectly unaware ;-- to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . <end> <end> <end>
2.1639898609995045
<start> <start> <start> he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . <end> <end> <end>
2.665365924661866
<start> <start> <start> his doing so drew her notice . <end> <end> <end>
2.200538837942242
<start> <start> <start> it was at sir william lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled . <end> <end> <end>

2.6719434980050507
<start> <start> <start> on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " did not you think , mr . darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ?" <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " you are a very strange creature by way of a friend !-- always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body !-- if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers ." <end> <end> <end>

1.987649407168832
<start> <start> <start> her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital . <end> <end> <end>
2.368406995243767
<start> <start> <start> mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . <end> <end> <end>
2.0300870673452165
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . <end> <end> <end>

2.634666608258471
<start> <start> <start> " i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself -- for i am fond of superior society ; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> and taking her hand , he would have given it to mr . darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william , " indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of dancing .-- i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5211135175597574

1.9226565242628966
<start> <start> <start> the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ', and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . <end> <end> <end>
1.9024467405594747

<start> <start> <start> i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well -- and indeed so i do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , i shall not say nay to him ; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william ' s in his regimentals ." <end> <end> <end>

3.0502259663093607

2.390561850805635
<start> <start> <start> in meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise . <end> <end> <end>
1.9128484046688567
<start> <start> <start> she was shewn into the breakfast - parlour , where all but jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise .-- that she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs . hurst and miss bingley ; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . <end> <end> <end>
2.2998333756977036
<start> <start> <start> she was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness .-- mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.500804227876402
<start> <start> <start> darcy said very little , and mr . hurst nothing at all . <end> <end> <end>
2.727394648419454
<start> <start> <start> the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s justifying her coming so far alone . <end> <end> <end>
1.9703065345778445
<start> <start> <start> the latter was thinking only of his breakfast . <end> <end> <end>
2.181515703988038
<start> <start> <start> her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . <end> <end> <end>
2.279164413987517
<start> <start> <start> miss bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room . <end> <end> <end>
2.2841121024048983
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . <end> <end> <end>
2.133915207052103
<start> <start> <start> she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . <end> <end> <end>
2.236709820743868
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth silently attended her . <end> <end> <end>
2.38112679146058
<start> <start> <start> when breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane . <end> <end> <end>
2.420098805820789
<start> <start> <start> the apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . <end> <end> <end>
2.541530205978543
<start> <start> <start> the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely . <end> <end> <end>
2.3639695429666174
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere . <end> <end> <end>
2.1601207147075976
<start> <start> <start> when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so . <end> <end> <end>
2.2995730533339005
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> jane was by no means better . <end> <end> <end>
2.7057510134362337
<start> <start> <start> the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . <end> <end> <end>
2.05416580811731
<start> <start> <start> their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency . <end> <end> <end>
3.0493382227585935
<start> <start> <start> his anxiety for jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others . <end> <end> <end>
2.206404042491681
<start> <start> <start> she had very little notice from any but him . <end> <end> <end>
2.1430285044187682
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley was engrossed by mr . darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for mr . hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her . <end> <end> <end>
2.294167404889197
<start> <start> <start> when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.804264276246998
<start> <start> <start> her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty . <end> <end> <end>
2.202984451041859
<start> <start> <start> mrs . hurst thought the same , and added , " she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . <end> <end> <end>
2.534144608150666
<start> <start> <start> i shall never forget her appearance this morning . <end> <end> <end>
2.2292099468732274

2.330133013030638
<start> <start> <start> very nonsensical to come at all ! <end> <end> <end>
2.4193005096325435

<start> <start> <start> her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0637003118433235
<start> <start> <start> " _you_ observed it , mr . darcy , i am sure ," said miss bingley ; " and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition ." <end> <end> <end>
2.7144150201946182
<start> <start> <start> " certainly not ." <end> <end> <end>
2.500361801872919

2.3310530901531
<start> <start> <start> it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " not at all ," he replied ; " they were brightened by the exercise ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2611035432521476
<start> <start> <start> -- a short pause followed this speech , and mrs . hurst began again . <end> <end> <end>

2.1224135312474037
<start> <start> <start> " that is capital ," added her sister , and they both laughed heartily . <end> <end> <end>

2.26157356658213
<start> <start> <start> with a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining - parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . <end> <end> <end>
2.3102844710393944
<start> <start> <start> she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.57628724256764
<start> <start> <start> on entering the drawing - room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book . <end> <end> <end>
2.168219599594413

<start> <start> <start> " i deserve neither such praise nor such censure ," cried elizabeth ; " i am _not_ a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things ." <end> <end> <end>
2.452153719773458
<start> <start> <start> " in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure ," said bingley ; " and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " your list of the common extent of accomplishments ," said darcy , " has too much truth . <end> <end> <end>

1.9327010242889253
<start> <start> <start> a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0948561150074116
<start> <start> <start> " all this she must possess ," added darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading ." <end> <end> <end>

2.231773462702136
<start> <start> <start> mrs . hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr . hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward . <end> <end> <end>
1.865868027134602
<start> <start> <start> as all conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.084039612279982
<start> <start> <start> " eliza bennet ," said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds . <end> <end> <end>
2.616713692844439
<start> <start> <start> but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art ." <end> <end> <end>
2.52830622378904
<start> <start> <start> " undoubtedly ," replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation . <end> <end> <end>

2.335565959564219
<start> <start> <start> bingley urged mr . jones ' s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians . <end> <end> <end>
2.046829963316142
<start> <start> <start> this , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled that mr . jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better . <end> <end> <end>
2.9012798828879416
<start> <start> <start> bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable . <end> <end> <end>
2.309327784392196

<start> <start> <start> elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ' s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr . bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters . <end> <end> <end>
2.443120184881429
<start> <start> <start> in spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . <end> <end> <end>
2.2897508498973784
<start> <start> <start> the note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast . <end> <end> <end>
1.988584374274121
<start> <start> <start> had she found jane in any apparent danger , mrs . bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield . <end> <end> <end>
2.2940514709647997
<start> <start> <start> she would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . <end> <end> <end>

2.333837271495684
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments . <end> <end> <end>
2.1914551920092378
<start> <start> <start> " i am sure ," she added , " if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with . <end> <end> <end>

2.031334578196308
<start> <start> <start> " yes , indeed ," cried mrs . bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood . <end> <end> <end>
2.3758928237539494
<start> <start> <start> " i assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3671744390395824
<start> <start> <start> every body was surprised ; and darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " aye -- that is because you have the right disposition . <end> <end> <end>
2.230210392014643
<start> <start> <start> but that gentleman ," looking at darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all ." <end> <end> <end>
2.344854590595343
<start> <start> <start> " indeed , mama , you are mistaken ," said elizabeth , blushing for her mother . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " you quite mistook mr . darcy . <end> <end> <end>
2.4749944734396796
<start> <start> <start> he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2977365896538338
<start> <start> <start> " certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger . <end> <end> <end>

2.0635622808225818

2.49980359433553

2.542693320310284
<start> <start> <start> it is a pity they are not handsome ! <end> <end> <end>
2.6081975682274767
<start> <start> <start> not that _i_ think charlotte so _very_ plain -- but then she is our particular friend ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9084678826222305
<start> <start> <start> " she seems a very pleasant young woman ," said bingley . <end> <end> <end>
2.079207302429316
<start> <start> <start> dear , yes ;-- but you must own she is very plain . <end> <end> <end>
2.5397068505505533
<start> <start> <start> lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me jane ' s beauty . <end> <end> <end>
2.176406042340703

<start> <start> <start> i do not trust my own partiality . <end> <end> <end>
2.399223192296672
<start> <start> <start> when she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . <end> <end> <end>
2.598216512078724
<start> <start> <start> but however he did not . <end> <end> <end>
2.866055032639858

2.1739816077227943
<start> <start> <start> but if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1237460485150366
<start> <start> <start> darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again . <end> <end> <end>
2.0663887606287985
<start> <start> <start> she longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence mrs . bennet began repeating her thanks to mr . bingley for his kindness to jane , with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy . <end> <end> <end>
2.7567376535972086
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . <end> <end> <end>
2.1121864383654345
<start> <start> <start> she performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but mrs . bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . <end> <end> <end>
2.1793526244044896
<start> <start> <start> upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward . <end> <end> <end>
2.217258939230514
<start> <start> <start> the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax mr . bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield . <end> <end> <end>
2.6517708130593074
<start> <start> <start> lydia was a stout , well - grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good - humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . <end> <end> <end>
2.068029553205312
<start> <start> <start> she had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self - consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ' s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . <end> <end> <end>
2.431381918659098
<start> <start> <start> she was very equal therefore to address mr . bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . <end> <end> <end>
2.600085829427978
<start> <start> <start> " i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball . <end> <end> <end>
2.315469772573501
<start> <start> <start> yes -- it would be much better to wait till jane was well , and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again . <end> <end> <end>
2.3457126773546415
<start> <start> <start> and when you have given _your_ ball ," she added , " i shall insist on their giving one also . <end> <end> <end>
2.329862512717657
<start> <start> <start> i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not ." <end> <end> <end>
2.499789073610968
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet and her daughters then departed , and elizabeth returned instantly to jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr . darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_ , in spite of all miss bingley ' s witticisms on _fine eyes_ . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand - writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each . <end> <end> <end>

1.8377881445100166
<start> <start> <start> " by all means ," cried bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of . <end> <end> <end>

2.2969477144738453
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy smiled ; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh . <end> <end> <end>
2.5803241135446258
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense . <end> <end> <end>
2.0344507380507184
<start> <start> <start> " i see your design , bingley ," said his friend .--" you dislike an argument , and want to silence this ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9973775987560274
<start> <start> <start> arguments are too much like disputes . <end> <end> <end>
2.4169684491685586
<start> <start> <start> " what you ask ," said elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and mr . darcy had much better finish his letter ." <end> <end> <end>
2.760291196457973
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter . <end> <end> <end>
2.2166314784571277
<start> <start> <start> when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music . <end> <end> <end>
2.401786887937549
<start> <start> <start> mrs . hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently mr . darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her . <end> <end> <end>
2.247395889278445
<start> <start> <start> she could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present . <end> <end> <end>
2.2005807814253315
<start> <start> <start> the supposition did not pain her . <end> <end> <end>
2.2718257847046726
<start> <start> <start> she liked him too little to care for his approbation . <end> <end> <end>
2.323391463023949
<start> <start> <start> after playing some italian songs , miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air ; and soon afterwards mr . darcy , drawing near elizabeth , said to her -- " do not you feel a great inclination , miss bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.195252134991709
<start> <start> <start> she smiled , but made no answer . <end> <end> <end>
2.2426459978533706
<start> <start> <start> said she , " i heard you before ; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply . <end> <end> <end>
2.8446586915688674
<start> <start> <start> you wanted me , i know , to say ' yes ,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt . <end> <end> <end>
2.1656310089253457
<start> <start> <start> " indeed i do not dare ." <end> <end> <end>
2.830860445616831
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her . <end> <end> <end>
2.147488104595568
<start> <start> <start> he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger . <end> <end> <end>
2.2864609314922517
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth . <end> <end> <end>
1.9330235836875342
<start> <start> <start> she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . <end> <end> <end>
1.8973810965270186
<start> <start> <start> " i hope ," said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers .-- and , if i may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses ." <end> <end> <end>
2.142974908078749
<start> <start> <start> " have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.1134809746768983
<start> <start> <start> yes .-- do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley . <end> <end> <end>
2.168593382413279
<start> <start> <start> put them next to your great uncle the judge . <end> <end> <end>
2.1300421989329523
<start> <start> <start> they are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines . <end> <end> <end>
2.5457929494690728
<start> <start> <start> at that moment they were met from another walk , by mrs . hurst and elizabeth herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.355611864640266
<start> <start> <start> " i did not know that you intended to walk ," said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard . <end> <end> <end>
2.5752529590937354
<start> <start> <start> " you used us abominably ill ," answered mrs . hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out ." <end> <end> <end>
2.245273936277524
<start> <start> <start> then taking the disengaged arm of mr . darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.3413700083503324
<start> <start> <start> the path just admitted three . <end> <end> <end>
2.268545892833062
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said ,-- " this walk is not wide enough for our party . <end> <end> <end>
1.8721072679133315
<start> <start> <start> but elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " no , no ; stay where you are .-- you are charmingly group ' d , and appear to uncommon advantage . <end> <end> <end>
2.259997937478015
<start> <start> <start> she then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two . <end> <end> <end>
2.194895708422244
<start> <start> <start> jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter xi . <end> <end> <end>
2.2893520976531194
<start> <start> <start> their powers of conversation were considerable . <end> <end> <end>
2.2633363043534267
<start> <start> <start> they could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . <end> <end> <end>
1.8736262411101763
<start> <start> <start> but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object . <end> <end> <end>
2.6348408978448705
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . <end> <end> <end>
2.6100856788802207
<start> <start> <start> he was full of joy and attention . <end> <end> <end>
2.207951842426169
<start> <start> <start> the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire - place , that she might be farther from the door . <end> <end> <end>
2.2595298431865842
<start> <start> <start> he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else . <end> <end> <end>
2.7852490395058096
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight . <end> <end> <end>
2.014473155513839
<start> <start> <start> she had obtained private intelligence that mr . darcy did not wish for cards ; and mr . hurst soon found even his open petition rejected . <end> <end> <end>
2.2737426365899336
<start> <start> <start> she assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her . <end> <end> <end>
2.760202902193818
<start> <start> <start> mr . hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep . <end> <end> <end>
2.4433084271909356
<start> <start> <start> darcy took up a book ; miss bingley did the same ; and mrs . hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with miss bennet . <end> <end> <end>
2.0296739006675897
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr . darcy ' s progress through _his_ book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . <end> <end> <end>
2.251402520930072
<start> <start> <start> she could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on . <end> <end> <end>
2.4485649562682497
<start> <start> <start> at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! <end> <end> <end>
2.235142822494399
<start> <start> <start> i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! <end> <end> <end>
2.4132681944393255
<start> <start> <start> how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book !-- when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library ." <end> <end> <end>
2.6074365755650546
<start> <start> <start> no one made any reply . <end> <end> <end>
2.3399339745779115
<start> <start> <start> she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield ?-- i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9650218582389962
<start> <start> <start> " if you mean darcy ," cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins -- but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4315145574242853
<start> <start> <start> it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0603889926827295
<start> <start> <start> " much more rational , my dear caroline , i dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball ." <end> <end> <end>
2.679896264930265
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.2461210513085486
<start> <start> <start> her figure was elegant , and she walked well ;-- but darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious . <end> <end> <end>
2.233050398255089
<start> <start> <start> in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to elizabeth , said , " miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room .-- i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude ." <end> <end> <end>
2.391264445630025
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . <end> <end> <end>
2.1879186368534436
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; mr . darcy looked up . <end> <end> <end>
2.4842552301053993
<start> <start> <start> he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . <end> <end> <end>
1.9771249128809825
<start> <start> <start> he was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere . <end> <end> <end>
2.04342499974078
<start> <start> <start> " what could he mean ? <end> <end> <end>
2.375574090651023
<start> <start> <start> she was dying to know what could be his meaning "-- and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? <end> <end> <end>
2.0752927500964575
<start> <start> <start> " not at all ," was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it ." <end> <end> <end>
2.215023504425906
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr . darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives . <end> <end> <end>
2.602300822907322
<start> <start> <start> " i have not the smallest objection to explaining them ," said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . <end> <end> <end>
2.5057085602678817
<start> <start> <start> " you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ;-- if the first , i should be completely in your way ;-- and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire ." <end> <end> <end>

2.4124190774791106

<start> <start> <start> her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . <end> <end> <end>
2.7886196526106586
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if mr . bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well .-- against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved -- nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow mr . bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . <end> <end> <end>
2.295195716163425
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . <end> <end> <end>
2.130895467169895
<start> <start> <start> the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered ; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . <end> <end> <end>

2.3427446576586144
<start> <start> <start> he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her . <end> <end> <end>
2.0449447917421906
<start> <start> <start> she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations . <end> <end> <end>
2.119768469495799
<start> <start> <start> she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself ,-- some shelves in the closets up stairs . <end> <end> <end>

2.6920070346930776

<start> <start> <start> her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . <end> <end> <end>
2.1800490471454395
<start> <start> <start> i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her .-- these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3325580423179426

2.233431125073582
<start> <start> <start> may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.018837014541792
<start> <start> <start> " they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9018132309234494
<start> <start> <start> mr . bennet ' s expectations were fully answered . <end> <end> <end>
2.232499676097991
<start> <start> <start> by tea - time however the dose had been enough , and mr . bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing - room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies . <end> <end> <end>
2.413531894880565
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library ,) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels .-- kitty stared at him , and lydia exclaimed .-- other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose fordyce ' s sermons . <end> <end> <end>

2.1473864665784093
<start> <start> <start> then turning to mr . bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon . <end> <end> <end>
2.5260526326634762
<start> <start> <start> mr . bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . <end> <end> <end>
1.89874144447345
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but mr . collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with mr . bennet , and prepared for backgammon . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter xv . <end> <end> <end>
2.2893520976531194
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance . <end> <end> <end>
2.171940176558075
<start> <start> <start> a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self - importance and humility . <end> <end> <end>
2.173643430107073
<start> <start> <start> having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . <end> <end> <end>
2.3260869724138065
<start> <start> <start> this was his plan of amends -- of atonement -- for inheriting their father ' s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . <end> <end> <end>
1.9993431008944353
<start> <start> <start> his plan did not vary on seeing them .-- miss bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice . <end> <end> <end>
1.903030310813689
<start> <start> <start> the next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ' s tête - à - tête with mrs . bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage - house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed on .--" as to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say -- she could not positively answer -- but she did not _know_ of any prepossession ;-- her _eldest_ daughter , she must just mention -- she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged ." <end> <end> <end>
2.077995199151519
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . <end> <end> <end>
2.0064910856488773
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces . <end> <end> <end>
2.650671567746724
<start> <start> <start> such doings discomposed mr . bennet exceedingly . <end> <end> <end>
2.8121670174899474
<start> <start> <start> in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting mr . collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and mr . collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . <end> <end> <end>
2.229352892031256
<start> <start> <start> in pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered meryton . <end> <end> <end>
2.037277852084489
<start> <start> <start> the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_ . <end> <end> <end>
2.2532802019162994
<start> <start> <start> their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them . <end> <end> <end>
2.0233476752851245
<start> <start> <start> but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman - like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way . <end> <end> <end>
2.2261614136123278
<start> <start> <start> the officer was the very mr . denny , concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed . <end> <end> <end>
2.177901899725811
<start> <start> <start> all were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and kitty and lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot . <end> <end> <end>
1.9606531637037439
<start> <start> <start> mr . denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , mr . wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps . <end> <end> <end>
2.4279394645188717
<start> <start> <start> this was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming . <end> <end> <end>
2.3785622208873023
<start> <start> <start> his appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address . <end> <end> <end>
2.3308677888558997
<start> <start> <start> the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation -- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street . <end> <end> <end>
2.01109397680475
<start> <start> <start> on distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . <end> <end> <end>
2.300742514095233
<start> <start> <start> bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object . <end> <end> <end>
2.285155052558307
<start> <start> <start> he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . <end> <end> <end>
2.5009493296620016
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . <end> <end> <end>
2.280175932231196
<start> <start> <start> both changed colour , one looked white , the other red . <end> <end> <end>
2.1326991256795456
<start> <start> <start> mr . wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat -- a salutation which mr . darcy just deigned to return . <end> <end> <end>
2.3280432216802933
<start> <start> <start> what could be the meaning of it ?-- it was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know . <end> <end> <end>
2.4949950391644817
<start> <start> <start> mr . denny and mr . wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr . philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of mrs . philips ' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation . <end> <end> <end>
2.7914446889885998
<start> <start> <start> she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . <end> <end> <end>
2.396531894712235
<start> <start> <start> mrs . philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr . denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant ' s commission in the ---- shire . <end> <end> <end>
2.4031277157925452
<start> <start> <start> she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had mr . wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2669501413773228
<start> <start> <start> some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr . wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from longbourn would come in the evening . <end> <end> <end>
2.6109347341925933
<start> <start> <start> this was agreed to , and mrs . philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . <end> <end> <end>
2.2662709596316484
<start> <start> <start> the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . <end> <end> <end>
2.2406671601817116
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless . <end> <end> <end>
2.4351534117694706
<start> <start> <start> as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister . <end> <end> <end>
2.2517153058440944
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins on his return highly gratified mrs . bennet by admiring mrs . philips ' s manners and politeness . <end> <end> <end>
2.5118279011527
<start> <start> <start> he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before . <end> <end> <end>
2.309009186802131
<start> <start> <start> something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life . <end> <end> <end>
2.4136740018400324
<start> <start> <start> chapter xvi . <end> <end> <end>
2.2893520976531194
<start> <start> <start> when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr . collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when mrs . philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine ' s drawing - rooms , and found that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room . <end> <end> <end>
2.154429443383294
<start> <start> <start> in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in mrs . philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . <end> <end> <end>
2.3286191524158544
<start> <start> <start> to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle - piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . <end> <end> <end>
2.123671871963058
<start> <start> <start> it was over at last however . <end> <end> <end>
2.2792408282177563
<start> <start> <start> the gentlemen did approach ; and when mr . wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . <end> <end> <end>
2.7065152361727236
<start> <start> <start> the officers of the ---- shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman - like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but mr . wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as _they_ were superior to the broad - faced stuffy uncle philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.09442125618796
<start> <start> <start> mr . wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread - bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker . <end> <end> <end>
2.0614317074262853
<start> <start> <start> with such rivals for the notice of the fair , as mr . wickham and the officers , mr . collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs . philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin . <end> <end> <end>
2.3372745881454735
<start> <start> <start> when the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist . <end> <end> <end>
2.1803949596054273
<start> <start> <start> " i know little of the game , at present ," said he , " but i shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life ----" mrs . philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . <end> <end> <end>
2.2222515173256046
<start> <start> <start> mr . wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia . <end> <end> <end>
2.1079900722195815
<start> <start> <start> at first there seemed danger of lydia ' s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular . <end> <end> <end>
2.0440839537607474
<start> <start> <start> allowing for the common demands of the game , mr . wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with mr . darcy . <end> <end> <end>
2.6700217676311544
<start> <start> <start> she dared not even mention that gentleman . <end> <end> <end>
2.291226381390951
<start> <start> <start> her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved . <end> <end> <end>
2.2564369820729713
<start> <start> <start> mr . wickham began the subject himself . <end> <end> <end>
2.3370020920688797
<start> <start> <start> " about a month ," said elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i understand ." <end> <end> <end>
2.59504743339945
<start> <start> <start> a clear ten thousand per annum . <end> <end> <end>
2.171883955060317
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth could not but look surprised . <end> <end> <end>
2.361576661422671
<start> <start> <start> " you may well be surprised , miss bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday .-- are you much acquainted with mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.115415724996743
<start> <start> <start> " as much as i ever wish to be ," cried elizabeth warmly ,--" i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable ." <end> <end> <end>
2.741420475614792
<start> <start> <start> " i have no right to give _my_ opinion ," said wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise . <end> <end> <end>
2.3000166352386446
<start> <start> <start> i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . <end> <end> <end>
2.470620274719329
<start> <start> <start> " upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except netherfield . <end> <end> <end>
2.033447412082701
<start> <start> <start> he is not at all liked in hertfordshire . <end> <end> <end>
2.6295444005742548
<start> <start> <start> every body is disgusted with his pride . <end> <end> <end>
2.352225245000201
<start> <start> <start> you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1268518807470045
<start> <start> <start> " i cannot pretend to be sorry ," said wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen . <end> <end> <end>
2.3164816178292007
<start> <start> <start> " i should take him , even on _my_ slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man ." <end> <end> <end>
2.332234850312848
<start> <start> <start> wickham only shook his head . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class ." <end> <end> <end>

2.6730129732761
<start> <start> <start> jane listened with astonishment and concern ;-- she knew not how to believe that mr . darcy could be so unworthy of mr . bingley ' s regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham .-- the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained . <end> <end> <end>
2.295882054820437
<start> <start> <start> " they have both ," said she , " been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . <end> <end> <end>

2.207290922561783
<start> <start> <start> the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; mr . bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday . <end> <end> <end>
2.3905734780601207

2.867498948101597
<start> <start> <start> they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs . bennet ' s civilities . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . <end> <end> <end>
2.25196648048306

2.472462297960934
<start> <start> <start> jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr . wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr . darcy ' s looks and behaviour . <end> <end> <end>
2.8039643867206427
<start> <start> <start> the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr . wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr . collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr . bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance . <end> <end> <end>
2.4989886228672056
<start> <start> <start> " i am by no means of opinion , i assure you ," said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially ,-- a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her ." <end> <end> <end>
2.248087517910816
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . <end> <end> <end>
2.205023910576012
<start> <start> <start> her liveliness had been never worse timed . <end> <end> <end>
2.1330054546705135
<start> <start> <start> there was no help for it however . <end> <end> <end>
2.4337243190712092
<start> <start> <start> mr . wickham ' s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr . collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could . <end> <end> <end>
2.4647333730246133
<start> <start> <start> she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .-- it now first struck her , that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . <end> <end> <end>
2.091941056276737
<start> <start> <start> the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_ . <end> <end> <end>
2.0901924042295104
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply . <end> <end> <end>
2.0863539767716315
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter xviii . <end> <end> <end>
2.2893520976531194
<start> <start> <start> till elizabeth entered the drawing - room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr . wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . <end> <end> <end>
2.1682159332999724
<start> <start> <start> the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her . <end> <end> <end>
2.181630322364116
<start> <start> <start> but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr . darcy ' s pleasure in the bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr . denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here ." <end> <end> <end>
2.44499873885013
<start> <start> <start> this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .-- attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham . <end> <end> <end>
2.0101836848369494
<start> <start> <start> she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr . bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . <end> <end> <end>
2.496106269087704
<start> <start> <start> but elizabeth was not formed for ill - humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . <end> <end> <end>
2.375807970705292
<start> <start> <start> the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification . <end> <end> <end>
2.1770591973207822
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give . <end> <end> <end>
1.9565955097906096
<start> <start> <start> the moment of her release from him was ecstacy . <end> <end> <end>
2.1460046893260714
<start> <start> <start> when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr . darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . <end> <end> <end>
2.6188384162168945
<start> <start> <start> " heaven forbid !-- _that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all !-- to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !-- do not wish me such an evil ." <end> <end> <end>
1.963728515356148
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr . darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it . <end> <end> <end>
2.042781267458121
<start> <start> <start> he replied , and was again silent . <end> <end> <end>
3.2116879509143694
<start> <start> <start> after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " it is _your_ turn to say something now , mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.4228600308307415
<start> <start> <start> he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . <end> <end> <end>
2.349294700803329
<start> <start> <start> " very well .-- that reply will do for the present .-- perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .-- but _now_ we may be silent ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8093755245107332
<start> <start> <start> " do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.023105324165416
<start> <start> <start> " sometimes . <end> <end> <end>
2.6649270322262435
<start> <start> <start> one must speak a little , you know . <end> <end> <end>
2.6757091271372726
<start> <start> <start> " are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.083291206236078
<start> <start> <start> " this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure ," said he . <end> <end> <end>
2.562946287610244
<start> <start> <start> " how near it may be to _mine_ , i cannot pretend to say .-- _you_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly ." <end> <end> <end>
2.080303684898168
<start> <start> <start> " i must not decide on my own performance ." <end> <end> <end>
2.237648509517794
<start> <start> <start> he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton . <end> <end> <end>
2.4148568965063824
<start> <start> <start> she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2041087061128244
<start> <start> <start> the effect was immediate . <end> <end> <end>
2.4421823093105726
<start> <start> <start> a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . <end> <end> <end>
2.480661928848974
<start> <start> <start> at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , " mr . wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends -- whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them , is less certain ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1763089100094577
<start> <start> <start> " he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship ," replied elizabeth with emphasis , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4541207395164517
<start> <start> <start> darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . <end> <end> <end>
2.2477817961497064
<start> <start> <start> at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr . darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . <end> <end> <end>
2.2898761443323146
<start> <start> <start> " i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir . <end> <end> <end>
2.5881859077646863
<start> <start> <start> such very superior dancing is not often seen . <end> <end> <end>
2.2418979009572415
<start> <start> <start> it is evident that you belong to the first circles . <end> <end> <end>
2.2463977521758633
<start> <start> <start> allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing at her sister and bingley ,) shall take place . <end> <end> <end>
2.491119430023427
<start> <start> <start> what congratulations will then flow in ! <end> <end> <end>
2.207572216476179
<start> <start> <start> i appeal to mr . darcy :-- but let me not interrupt you , sir .-- you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me ." <end> <end> <end>
2.075149924394605
<start> <start> <start> the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir william ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together . <end> <end> <end>
2.172630576085212
<start> <start> <start> recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " sir william ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4521928872329593
<start> <start> <start> " i do not think we were speaking at all . <end> <end> <end>
2.2387630631700093
<start> <start> <start> sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .-- we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine ." <end> <end> <end>
2.135722504819932
<start> <start> <start> said he , smiling . <end> <end> <end>
2.794907218182178
<start> <start> <start> no .-- i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings ." <end> <end> <end>
2.6700308268404314
<start> <start> <start> " the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes -- does it ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.9088768642545444
<start> <start> <start> " yes , always ," she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " i remember hearing you once say , mr . darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable . <end> <end> <end>
2.402699305271933
<start> <start> <start> " i am ," said he , with a firm voice . <end> <end> <end>
2.7388642383332313
<start> <start> <start> " and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.007903622298157
<start> <start> <start> " it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first ." <end> <end> <end>
2.082760776521563
<start> <start> <start> " may i ask to what these questions tend ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.2350076035945263
<start> <start> <start> " merely to the illustration of _your_ character ," said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . <end> <end> <end>
2.0840231485748957
<start> <start> <start> " i am trying to make it out ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3227033201624665
<start> <start> <start> " and what is your success ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.583252006557791
<start> <start> <start> she shook her head . <end> <end> <end>
2.4316146250611985
<start> <start> <start> " i do not get on at all . <end> <end> <end>
2.204456462184834
<start> <start> <start> i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly ." <end> <end> <end>
2.09805143604513
<start> <start> <start> " i can readily believe ," answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either ." <end> <end> <end>
2.200079010776984
<start> <start> <start> " but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5430763702377184
<start> <start> <start> they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham !-- your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr . darcy ' s steward . <end> <end> <end>
2.4316305073280553
<start> <start> <start> let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr . darcy ' s using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr . darcy in a most infamous manner . <end> <end> <end>
2.576746339421305
<start> <start> <start> i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr . darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . <end> <end> <end>
2.7728290801337607
<start> <start> <start> his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it . <end> <end> <end>
2.7508637669046467
<start> <start> <start> i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9078379388569227
<start> <start> <start> " his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same ," said elizabeth angrily ; " for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr . darcy ' s steward , and of _that_ , i can assure you , he informed me himself ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5083185506668695
<start> <start> <start> " insolent girl !" <end> <end> <end>
2.4763060057607427
<start> <start> <start> said elizabeth to herself .--" you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . <end> <end> <end>
1.951777331546227
<start> <start> <start> i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.2905630623796376
<start> <start> <start> darcy ." <end> <end> <end>
2.47049948410753
<start> <start> <start> she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley . <end> <end> <end>
2.2564835449852563
<start> <start> <start> jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .-- elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane ' s being in the fairest way for happiness . <end> <end> <end>
2.2667974300717084
<start> <start> <start> " i want to know ," said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about mr . wickham . <end> <end> <end>
2.921889171510839
<start> <start> <start> but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon ." <end> <end> <end>
2.304395283439327
<start> <start> <start> " no ," replied jane , " i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you . <end> <end> <end>
3.0497335690034446
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr . darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr . wickham has deserved much less attention from mr . darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , mr . wickham is by no means a respectable young man . <end> <end> <end>
2.831404593447018
<start> <start> <start> i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr . darcy ' s regard ." <end> <end> <end>
2.6761521780425754
<start> <start> <start> " mr . bingley does not know mr . wickham himself ?" <end> <end> <end>
3.342106318884989
<start> <start> <start> " no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton ." <end> <end> <end>
2.075393056785892
<start> <start> <start> " this account then is what he has received from mr . darcy . <end> <end> <end>
2.526509198917464
<start> <start> <start> " i have not a doubt of mr . bingley ' s sincerity ," said elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . <end> <end> <end>
2.5872111188392055
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2624882981393077
<start> <start> <start> on their being joined by mr . bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr . collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . <end> <end> <end>
2.303103172095223
<start> <start> <start> " i have found out ," said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness . <end> <end> <end>
2.330660646356923
<start> <start> <start> i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine . <end> <end> <end>
2.2805577503924397
<start> <start> <start> who would have thought of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly !-- i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . <end> <end> <end>
2.019946379191581
<start> <start> <start> my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9749819408121272
<start> <start> <start> " you are not going to introduce yourself to mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.7505722265283548
<start> <start> <start> " indeed i am . <end> <end> <end>
2.4659221068426485
<start> <start> <start> i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . <end> <end> <end>
2.0345669207400623
<start> <start> <start> i believe him to be lady catherine ' s _nephew_ . <end> <end> <end>
2.8656617912019264
<start> <start> <start> it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ' night ." <end> <end> <end>
2.359684959082058
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that mr . darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr . darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .-- mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.275316551149477
<start> <start> <start> collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . <end> <end> <end>
1.9867308299390583
<start> <start> <start> you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty . <end> <end> <end>
1.9831657332279717
<start> <start> <start> pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8620149495991325
<start> <start> <start> and with a low bow he left her to attack mr . darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident . <end> <end> <end>
2.2095356015015506
<start> <start> <start> her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words " apology ," " hunsford ," and " lady catherine de bourgh ." <end> <end> <end>
2.385981266579388
<start> <start> <start> -- it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man . <end> <end> <end>
2.719398039425954
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr . collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . <end> <end> <end>
2.4131124523362177
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr . darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way . <end> <end> <end>
2.457753948371172
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins then returned to elizabeth . <end> <end> <end>
2.355556107687524
<start> <start> <start> " i have no reason , i assure you ," said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception . <end> <end> <end>
2.534138997771545
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . <end> <end> <end>
2.522411950911725
<start> <start> <start> he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . <end> <end> <end>
2.53496759992205
<start> <start> <start> upon the whole , i am much pleased with him ." <end> <end> <end>
2.912000386975567
<start> <start> <start> she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley ' s two sisters . <end> <end> <end>
2.1584465584497705
<start> <start> <start> bingley .-- it was an animating subject , and mrs . bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match . <end> <end> <end>
2.587730504147826
<start> <start> <start> his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self - gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do . <end> <end> <end>
2.5758049181335827
<start> <start> <start> it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . <end> <end> <end>
2.330811050306192
<start> <start> <start> it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs . bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . <end> <end> <end>
2.1682051163136524
<start> <start> <start> she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it . <end> <end> <end>
2.0155830282593508
<start> <start> <start> in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr . darcy , who sat opposite to them . <end> <end> <end>
2.26636588025223
<start> <start> <start> her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical . <end> <end> <end>
2.1523626208718656
<start> <start> <start> " what is mr . darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ? <end> <end> <end>
3.4628519260831934
<start> <start> <start> i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1665212258672444
<start> <start> <start> " for heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower .-- what advantage can it be to you to offend mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.0523085817138202
<start> <start> <start> darcy ?-- you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing ." <end> <end> <end>
2.285451406462137
<start> <start> <start> nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . <end> <end> <end>
3.2739871917947165
<start> <start> <start> her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . <end> <end> <end>
2.373322704333923
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation . <end> <end> <end>
1.9611616828437943
<start> <start> <start> she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr . darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . <end> <end> <end>
2.5229215938897984
<start> <start> <start> the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity . <end> <end> <end>
1.9164892490176477
<start> <start> <start> at length however mrs . bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken . <end> <end> <end>
2.156524864077935
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth now began to revive . <end> <end> <end>
2.3126236936663287
<start> <start> <start> but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company . <end> <end> <end>
2.130421651327652
<start> <start> <start> by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance ,-- but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song . <end> <end> <end>
2.0504826805253367
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another . <end> <end> <end>
2.013889310794711
<start> <start> <start> mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected .-- elizabeth was in agonies . <end> <end> <end>
2.2139365172142056
<start> <start> <start> she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley . <end> <end> <end>
2.485112314345399
<start> <start> <start> she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave . <end> <end> <end>
2.421262721267534
<start> <start> <start> she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night . <end> <end> <end>
2.039940194999387
<start> <start> <start> you have delighted us long enough . <end> <end> <end>
2.261305389652925
<start> <start> <start> mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .-- others of the party were now applied to . <end> <end> <end>
2.305657831898081
<start> <start> <start> " if i ," said mr . collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .-- i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . <end> <end> <end>
2.192203936390949
<start> <start> <start> the rector of a parish has much to do .-- in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron . <end> <end> <end>
2.087604877687811
<start> <start> <start> he must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible . <end> <end> <end>
2.289584063237136
<start> <start> <start> and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . <end> <end> <end>
2.307755141066989
<start> <start> <start> i cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family ." <end> <end> <end>
2.006687668502774
<start> <start> <start> and with a bow to mr . darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .-- many stared .-- many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr . bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr . collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half - whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . <end> <end> <end>
2.2944744903427488
<start> <start> <start> to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . <end> <end> <end>
2.226636692591627
<start> <start> <start> that his two sisters and mr . darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . <end> <end> <end>
2.6965815327201557
<start> <start> <start> the rest of the evening brought her little amusement . <end> <end> <end>
2.377377240305927
<start> <start> <start> she was teazed by mr . collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . <end> <end> <end>
2.6043627936943223
<start> <start> <start> in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.0470317063762486
<start> <start> <start> he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . <end> <end> <end>
2.5419729612517608
<start> <start> <start> there was no arguing upon such a project . <end> <end> <end>
2.3108371534281096
<start> <start> <start> she was at least free from the offence of mr . darcy ' s farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . <end> <end> <end>
2.219024193964815
<start> <start> <start> she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr . wickham , and rejoiced in it . <end> <end> <end>
2.790832886520461
<start> <start> <start> the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mrs . bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . <end> <end> <end>
2.2312048717996706
<start> <start> <start> mrs . hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . <end> <end> <end>
2.1517941076616265
<start> <start> <start> they repulsed every attempt of mrs . bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr . collins , who was complimenting mr . bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests . <end> <end> <end>
2.5384694989437304
<start> <start> <start> darcy said nothing at all . <end> <end> <end>
2.4198681118288174
<start> <start> <start> mr . bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . <end> <end> <end>
2.1855619215504865
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . <end> <end> <end>
2.255859249577745
<start> <start> <start> accompanied by a violent yawn . <end> <end> <end>
2.4327556508560324
<start> <start> <start> bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . <end> <end> <end>
2.395334483455152
<start> <start> <start> of having another daughter married to mr . collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . <end> <end> <end>
2.649414107243138
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_ , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr . bingley and netherfield . <end> <end> <end>

2.2954105815673267
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins made his declaration in form . <end> <end> <end>
2.1818883894383347
<start> <start> <start> on finding mrs . bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.6960910075633775
<start> <start> <start> before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs . bennet instantly answered , " oh dear !-- yes -- certainly .-- i am sure lizzy will be very happy -- i am sure she can have no objection .-- come , kitty , i want you up stairs ." <end> <end> <end>
2.495618541192649
<start> <start> <start> collins must excuse me .-- he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear . <end> <end> <end>
2.403047342233336
<start> <start> <start> i am going away myself ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3706084810643167
<start> <start> <start> " no , no , nonsense , lizzy .-- i desire you will stay where you are ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1074536060159974
<start> <start> <start> -- and upon elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " lizzy , i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.128011175510218
<start> <start> <start> collins ." <end> <end> <end>
2.73147447750685
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction -- and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion . <end> <end> <end>
2.042184821481542
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr . collins began . <end> <end> <end>
2.8990473632464058
<start> <start> <start> " believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections . <end> <end> <end>
2.3364585687142414
<start> <start> <start> you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother ' s permission for this address . <end> <end> <end>
2.299726467774472
<start> <start> <start> almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life . <end> <end> <end>
2.232197896542933
<start> <start> <start> but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as i certainly did ." <end> <end> <end>
2.149475317981468
<start> <start> <start> the idea of mr . collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : " my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish . <end> <end> <end>
2.1657882112928544
<start> <start> <start> secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly -- which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness . <end> <end> <end>
2.3255074997259
<start> <start> <start> twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too !) <end> <end> <end>
2.261458863033626
<start> <start> <start> on this subject ; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford -- between our pools at quadrille , while mrs . jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh ' s foot - stool , that she said , ' mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.2103291474198015
<start> <start> <start> collins , you must marry . <end> <end> <end>
2.951672338419855
<start> <start> <start> this is my advice . <end> <end> <end>
2.4749055659218615
<start> <start> <start> find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her .' <end> <end> <end>
2.7848119614106186
<start> <start> <start> allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . <end> <end> <end>
2.5903495487189234
<start> <start> <start> but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer ,) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years . <end> <end> <end>
2.333420154171138
<start> <start> <start> this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . <end> <end> <end>
2.6159709441595065

2.451903121030872
<start> <start> <start> on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3227053460008174
<start> <start> <start> it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . <end> <end> <end>
2.0790495184141053
<start> <start> <start> " you are too hasty , sir ," she cried . <end> <end> <end>
2.298204876040454
<start> <start> <start> " you forget that i have made no answer . <end> <end> <end>
2.487284150443699
<start> <start> <start> accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . <end> <end> <end>
2.192277844682927
<start> <start> <start> " i am not now to learn ," replied mr . collins , with a formal wave of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . <end> <end> <end>
2.2244322133002767
<start> <start> <start> i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long ." <end> <end> <end>
2.257654743429777
<start> <start> <start> " upon my word , sir ," cried elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . <end> <end> <end>
2.2197554045386356
<start> <start> <start> i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . <end> <end> <end>
1.929321304138946
<start> <start> <start> i am perfectly serious in my refusal .-- you could not make _me_ happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so .-- nay , were your friend lady catherine to know me , i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3936968004555377
<start> <start> <start> " were it certain that lady catherine would think so ," said mr . collins very gravely --" but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you . <end> <end> <end>
2.3359626576078845
<start> <start> <start> and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3642761307309987
<start> <start> <start> " indeed , mr . collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . <end> <end> <end>
2.4328481077437862
<start> <start> <start> you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say . <end> <end> <end>
2.1793175040205583
<start> <start> <start> i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . <end> <end> <end>
2.2508831462406476
<start> <start> <start> in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach . <end> <end> <end>
2.2819905464538923
<start> <start> <start> this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4832150059907323
<start> <start> <start> if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one ." <end> <end> <end>
2.315216307287017
<start> <start> <start> " you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . <end> <end> <end>
2.271463740589278
<start> <start> <start> my reasons for believing it are briefly these :-- it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable . <end> <end> <end>
1.9656542654013818
<start> <start> <start> my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . <end> <end> <end>
2.21722550846373
<start> <start> <start> your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females ." <end> <end> <end>

2.0808141357398573
<start> <start> <start> cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1082555642732563
<start> <start> <start> to such perseverance in wilful self - deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female . <end> <end> <end>
1.9713403406866015
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs . bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast - room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . <end> <end> <end>
1.9656141427688962
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . <end> <end> <end>
2.038222473150339
<start> <start> <start> this information , however , startled mrs . bennet ;-- she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so . <end> <end> <end>
2.7858530213688484

2.4556219970186084
<start> <start> <start> " pardon me for interrupting you , madam ," cried mr . collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . <end> <end> <end>
2.3608080243245064
<start> <start> <start> if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9381902005299088
<start> <start> <start> " sir , you quite misunderstand me ," said mrs . bennet , alarmed . <end> <end> <end>

3.1093586155333033
<start> <start> <start> she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " oh ! <end> <end> <end>

2.4305185996194165
<start> <start> <start> mr . bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication . <end> <end> <end>

2.5725611957727836
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but mrs . bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . <end> <end> <end>
2.393342458407121
<start> <start> <start> " what do you mean , mr . bennet , by talking in this way ? <end> <end> <end>

2.9369524811427707
<start> <start> <start> not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs . bennet give up the point . <end> <end> <end>
3.092555166561585
<start> <start> <start> she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns . <end> <end> <end>
2.0970795080863254
<start> <start> <start> she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ;-- and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks . <end> <end> <end>
1.7630902115791545
<start> <start> <start> though her manner varied however , her determination never did . <end> <end> <end>
2.061338036529017
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . <end> <end> <end>
2.1483924024312224
<start> <start> <start> he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . <end> <end> <end>
2.0807029362922647
<start> <start> <start> his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret . <end> <end> <end>
2.377320250689853
<start> <start> <start> while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them . <end> <end> <end>

2.7396749805309866
<start> <start> <start> charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast - room , where mrs . bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family . <end> <end> <end>
2.3576897156402055
<start> <start> <start> " pray do , my dear miss lucas ," she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves ." <end> <end> <end>
2.392201917917791
<start> <start> <start> charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth . <end> <end> <end>
2.4135727506524245
<start> <start> <start> " aye , there she comes ," continued mrs . bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way .-- but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all -- and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .-- _i_ shall not be able to keep you -- and so i warn you .-- i have done with you from this very day .-- i told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . <end> <end> <end>

2.2570625019442327
<start> <start> <start> her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation . <end> <end> <end>
1.837440549630916
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr . collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . <end> <end> <end>
2.133651532623921
<start> <start> <start> in a doleful voice mrs . bennet thus began the projected conversation .--" oh ! <end> <end> <end>
2.2399478152280796

2.9865836832963963
<start> <start> <start> -- " my dear madam ," replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point . <end> <end> <end>
2.861804197910721
<start> <start> <start> far be it from me ," he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter . <end> <end> <end>
2.182117834196705
<start> <start> <start> resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ; and i trust i am resigned . <end> <end> <end>
2.5701306557652357
<start> <start> <start> perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . <end> <end> <end>
1.8827576795204424
<start> <start> <start> you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and mr . bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . <end> <end> <end>
2.2694172054594426

2.264544519449551

2.633120262952545
<start> <start> <start> the discussion of mr . collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . <end> <end> <end>
2.4747340080367626
<start> <start> <start> as for the gentleman himself , _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . <end> <end> <end>
1.846814222497209
<start> <start> <start> he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend . <end> <end> <end>
2.8015130408862605
<start> <start> <start> the morrow produced no abatement of mrs . bennet ' s ill humour or ill health . <end> <end> <end>
2.2938519097157433
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins was also in the same state of angry pride . <end> <end> <end>
2.312020053560017
<start> <start> <start> he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay . <end> <end> <end>
2.3853762294299368
<start> <start> <start> after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr . wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball . <end> <end> <end>
2.486267575505506
<start> <start> <start> he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over .-- to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed . <end> <end> <end>
2.4393754320335512
<start> <start> <start> she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her . <end> <end> <end>
2.243914707632946
<start> <start> <start> his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . <end> <end> <end>
2.3138840953956517
<start> <start> <start> soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately . <end> <end> <end>
2.3598579697664355
<start> <start> <start> jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs . <end> <end> <end>
2.0146338650418922
<start> <start> <start> when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , " this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal . <end> <end> <end>
2.4817007741179355
<start> <start> <start> the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> you shall hear what she says ." <end> <end> <end>
2.550504317730987
<start> <start> <start> she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr . hurst had a house . <end> <end> <end>
2.0091684801276313
<start> <start> <start> " i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . <end> <end> <end>

2.3714106248137052
<start> <start> <start> to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr . bingley ' s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his . <end> <end> <end>
2.5047713834274763

2.1515539705257027
<start> <start> <start> but the case is this . <end> <end> <end>
2.443418021582473
<start> <start> <start> we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way . <end> <end> <end>
2.2710080385367344
<start> <start> <start> but , my dearest jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3818165968313183
<start> <start> <start> " if we thought alike of miss bingley ," replied jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy . <end> <end> <end>
2.3234736578347723
<start> <start> <start> but i know the foundation is unjust . <end> <end> <end>
2.464120981047044
<start> <start> <start> caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ; and all that i can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself ." <end> <end> <end>
2.501663104600601
<start> <start> <start> " that is right .-- you could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine . <end> <end> <end>
2.267040302569445
<start> <start> <start> believe her to be deceived by all means . <end> <end> <end>
2.5674017635746615
<start> <start> <start> you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer ." <end> <end> <end>
2.361634248283828
<start> <start> <start> " you must decide for yourself ," said elizabeth , " and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1381773561472253
<start> <start> <start> " how can you talk so ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.180380090424991
<start> <start> <start> -- said jane faintly smiling ,--" you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate ." <end> <end> <end>
2.285938905093242
<start> <start> <start> " i did not think you would ;-- and that being the case , i cannot consider your situation with much compassion ." <end> <end> <end>
2.218398821348994
<start> <start> <start> " but if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . <end> <end> <end>
2.0680461691095857
<start> <start> <start> a thousand things may arise in six months !" <end> <end> <end>
2.102884078434241
<start> <start> <start> the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt . <end> <end> <end>
2.3193366697461246
<start> <start> <start> it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one . <end> <end> <end>
2.13472445959912
<start> <start> <start> she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . <end> <end> <end>
2.4874604649228607
<start> <start> <start> jane ' s temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . <end> <end> <end>
2.3364066306168523
<start> <start> <start> they agreed that mrs . bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together . <end> <end> <end>
2.438192444504487
<start> <start> <start> after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr . bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses . <end> <end> <end>
2.511991482427559
<start> <start> <start> chapter xxii . <end> <end> <end>
2.633120262952545
<start> <start> <start> the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr . collins . <end> <end> <end>
2.675708898929416
<start> <start> <start> " it keeps him in good humour ," said she , " and i am more obliged to you than i can express ." <end> <end> <end>
2.34475365329353
<start> <start> <start> charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . <end> <end> <end>
2.2627878197483757
<start> <start> <start> this was very amiable , but charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of ;-- its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of mr . collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.007455541529071
<start> <start> <start> such was miss lucas ' s scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon . <end> <end> <end>
2.238139013944832
<start> <start> <start> but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet . <end> <end> <end>
2.0632798630108353
<start> <start> <start> his reception however was of the most flattering kind . <end> <end> <end>
2.438022414440375
<start> <start> <start> miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . <end> <end> <end>
2.265502174760313
<start> <start> <start> but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there . <end> <end> <end>
1.9171128507372976
<start> <start> <start> in as short a time as mr . collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . <end> <end> <end>
2.28863135889576
<start> <start> <start> the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained . <end> <end> <end>
1.8094400385262601
<start> <start> <start> sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . <end> <end> <end>
2.1746776204647107
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair . <end> <end> <end>
2.021659404887159
<start> <start> <start> lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr . bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr . collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st . james ' s . <end> <end> <end>
2.1100963256918526
<start> <start> <start> the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion . <end> <end> <end>
2.2943501961530504
<start> <start> <start> the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte ' s dying an old maid . <end> <end> <end>
2.0376409445859918
<start> <start> <start> charlotte herself was tolerably composed . <end> <end> <end>
2.293430352013453
<start> <start> <start> she had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . <end> <end> <end>
2.4323663702608602
<start> <start> <start> her reflections were in general satisfactory . <end> <end> <end>
2.4569895624417466
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . <end> <end> <end>
2.214440018754823
<start> <start> <start> but still he would be her husband .-- without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well - educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want . <end> <end> <end>
1.9647520445385338
<start> <start> <start> this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty - seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . <end> <end> <end>
2.171709639986917
<start> <start> <start> she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr . collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . <end> <end> <end>
2.594321471770032
<start> <start> <start> a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self - denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love . <end> <end> <end>
2.0501988553193686
<start> <start> <start> as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs . bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . <end> <end> <end>
2.1583692517852944
<start> <start> <start> " my dear madam ," he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5872437911417423
<start> <start> <start> they were all astonished ; and mr . bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " but is there not danger of lady catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ?-- you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2320743239858767
<start> <start> <start> " you cannot be too much on your guard . <end> <end> <end>
2.325928054201889
<start> <start> <start> " believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire . <end> <end> <end>
2.1016009566254574
<start> <start> <start> as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2573136798886653
<start> <start> <start> with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . <end> <end> <end>
1.9808161912956965
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . <end> <end> <end>
2.46177509351399
<start> <start> <start> miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before . <end> <end> <end>
2.5171308105940944
<start> <start> <start> the possibility of mr . collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " engaged to mr . collins ! <end> <end> <end>
2.506894212192568
<start> <start> <start> my dear charlotte ,-- impossible !" <end> <end> <end>
2.397813588118259
<start> <start> <start> the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , " why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ?-- do you think it incredible that mr . collins should be able to procure any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.3521965285486766
<start> <start> <start> but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . <end> <end> <end>
2.416287320091653
<start> <start> <start> but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done . <end> <end> <end>
3.133286938344955
<start> <start> <start> i am not romantic you know . <end> <end> <end>
2.3374831650713612
<start> <start> <start> i never was . <end> <end> <end>
2.515840664940359
<start> <start> <start> i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering mr . collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2414926012010534
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth quietly answered " undoubtedly ;"-- and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . <end> <end> <end>
2.210779758308647
<start> <start> <start> charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . <end> <end> <end>
2.4322926858553044
<start> <start> <start> it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match . <end> <end> <end>
2.132215631554216
<start> <start> <start> the strangeness of mr . collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . <end> <end> <end>
2.3207540072244193
<start> <start> <start> charlotte the wife of mr . collins , was a most humiliating picture !-- and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen . <end> <end> <end>
2.176116098037863
<start> <start> <start> chapter xxiii . <end> <end> <end>
2.633120262952545
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . <end> <end> <end>
2.13657328959139
<start> <start> <start> with many compliments to them , and much self - gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter ,-- to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs . bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , " good lord ! <end> <end> <end>
2.0339557062492313
<start> <start> <start> sir william , how can you tell such a story ?-- do not you know that mr . collins wants to marry lizzy ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.671538512412257
<start> <start> <start> nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william ' s good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy . <end> <end> <end>
2.1596358034212995
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr . collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london . <end> <end> <end>
2.1538992720251815
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . <end> <end> <end>
2.0389164476374817
<start> <start> <start> two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . <end> <end> <end>
2.596542556621467
<start> <start> <start> nothing could console and nothing appease her .-- nor did that day wear out her resentment . <end> <end> <end>
1.8726428687741243
<start> <start> <start> a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter . <end> <end> <end>
2.0495472678650555
<start> <start> <start> jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . <end> <end> <end>
2.135802042994621
<start> <start> <start> kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr . collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton . <end> <end> <end>
2.240502393325741
<start> <start> <start> lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs . bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs . bennet ' s sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . <end> <end> <end>
2.362239806856175
<start> <start> <start> her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . <end> <end> <end>
2.1147495575187056
<start> <start> <start> jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . <end> <end> <end>
2.1818206827622424
<start> <start> <start> the promised letter of thanks from mr . collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have prompted . <end> <end> <end>
2.2380484032750534
<start> <start> <start> after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . <end> <end> <end>
2.2198289887220604
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins ' s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs . bennet . <end> <end> <end>
2.603691689600721
<start> <start> <start> on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .-- it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .-- she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . <end> <end> <end>
2.1195286018470134
<start> <start> <start> such were the gentle murmurs of mrs . bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr . bingley ' s continued absence . <end> <end> <end>
2.5836166834233403
<start> <start> <start> neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . <end> <end> <end>
2.3269580982673843
<start> <start> <start> day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs . bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . <end> <end> <end>
2.002770346321855
<start> <start> <start> even elizabeth began to fear -- not that bingley was indifferent -- but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . <end> <end> <end>
2.02137239248532
<start> <start> <start> but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used . <end> <end> <end>
2.310034761508346
<start> <start> <start> it needed all jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . <end> <end> <end>
2.0738663114602574
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction . <end> <end> <end>
2.242338627275972
<start> <start> <start> the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed . <end> <end> <end>
2.2658815417872424
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet was really in a most pitiable state . <end> <end> <end>
2.2781970882855354
<start> <start> <start> the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . <end> <end> <end>
2.036097659821948
<start> <start> <start> the sight of miss lucas was odious to her . <end> <end> <end>
2.3595232272528377
<start> <start> <start> as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . <end> <end> <end>
1.9759867723739688
<start> <start> <start> she complained bitterly of all this to her husband . <end> <end> <end>
2.480674106704474
<start> <start> <start> " indeed , mr . bennet ," said she , " it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for _her_ , and live to see her take my place in it !" <end> <end> <end>
2.7033763080384112
<start> <start> <start> let us hope for better things . <end> <end> <end>
2.1973599061434066
<start> <start> <start> let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2434877176110164
<start> <start> <start> this was not very consoling to mrs . bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate . <end> <end> <end>
3.0536608528261517
<start> <start> <start> if it was not for the entail i should not mind it ." <end> <end> <end>
2.7141748577595775

<start> <start> <start> poor jane ! <end> <end> <end>
2.691264105274322

<start> <start> <start> it had better have happened to _you_ , lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . <end> <end> <end>
2.309124338088091
<start> <start> <start> change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1009913818506862
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready acquiescence . <end> <end> <end>
2.2295417539370512
<start> <start> <start> " i hope ," added mrs . gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . <end> <end> <end>
2.435225387501792
<start> <start> <start> we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2784472467854715
<start> <start> <start> " and _that_ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr . darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london ! <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> my dear aunt , how could you think of it ? <end> <end> <end>
2.5681251573367287
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month ' s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , mr . bingley never stirs without him ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " she will drop the acquaintance entirely ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1487201662386375
<start> <start> <start> it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re - animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane ' s attractions . <end> <end> <end>
2.3049891842780768
<start> <start> <start> miss bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . <end> <end> <end>
2.396553468357148
<start> <start> <start> the gardiners staid a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . <end> <end> <end>
2.69900572675973
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . <end> <end> <end>
2.3703876524162477
<start> <start> <start> when the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers mr . wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , mrs . gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . <end> <end> <end>
2.60277715420557
<start> <start> <start> without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment . <end> <end> <end>
2.553175521406436

<start> <start> <start> about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire , to which he belonged . <end> <end> <end>
2.3233386433835483
<start> <start> <start> they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring . <end> <end> <end>
2.5811880930628637
<start> <start> <start> here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse . <end> <end> <end>
2.121220005900777
<start> <start> <start> in comparing her recollection of pemberley , with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.1040596524423747
<start> <start> <start> on being made acquainted with the present mr . darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard mr . fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill - natured boy . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> mrs . gardiner ' s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : " you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly . <end> <end> <end>
2.2674281828896485

2.066185560873767
<start> <start> <start> i have nothing to say against _him_ ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better . <end> <end> <end>

2.530559537626202
<start> <start> <start> my father , however , is partial to mr . wickham . <end> <end> <end>
3.251636709834805
<start> <start> <start> in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ? <end> <end> <end>
2.1759277066623177
<start> <start> <start> all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . <end> <end> <end>
3.331953601955995
<start> <start> <start> when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> in short , i will do my best ." <end> <end> <end>
2.791482500904529
<start> <start> <start> at least , you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1590846062213855
<start> <start> <start> " as i did the other day ," said elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_ . <end> <end> <end>
2.6140652638802506
<start> <start> <start> but do not imagine that he is always here so often . <end> <end> <end>
2.5716798022771417
<start> <start> <start> it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . <end> <end> <end>
2.241164002789662

2.489946276076579
<start> <start> <start> her aunt assured her that she was ; and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented . <end> <end> <end>
2.400795884372475
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane ; but as he took up his abode with the lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs . bennet . <end> <end> <end>
2.25139925523233
<start> <start> <start> his marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill - natured tone that she " _wished_ they might be happy ." <end> <end> <end>
2.324446148717456
<start> <start> <start> thursday was to be the wedding day , and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.3543271009063047
<start> <start> <start> as they went down stairs together , charlotte said , " i shall depend on hearing from you very often , eliza ." <end> <end> <end>
2.403805223835271
<start> <start> <start> " _that_ you certainly shall ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " i am not likely to leave kent for some time . <end> <end> <end>
2.4436602234309253
<start> <start> <start> promise me , therefore , to come to hunsford ." <end> <end> <end>
3.032111903670887
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit . <end> <end> <end>
2.368930145961474
<start> <start> <start> " my father and maria are to come to me in march ," added charlotte , " and i hope you will consent to be of the party . <end> <end> <end>
2.555119786146952
<start> <start> <start> indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them ." <end> <end> <end>
2.724062273840862
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . <end> <end> <end>
2.2146458535938547
<start> <start> <start> charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . <end> <end> <end>
2.2878626099894057
<start> <start> <start> she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . <end> <end> <end>
2.1386897270623106
<start> <start> <start> the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . <end> <end> <end>
2.461764611682528
<start> <start> <start> it was mr . collins ' s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest . <end> <end> <end>
2.3084287931283947
<start> <start> <start> jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london ; and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys . <end> <end> <end>
2.5739051283427226
<start> <start> <start> her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is . <end> <end> <end>
1.989779146488006
<start> <start> <start> jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from caroline . <end> <end> <end>
2.4272250606909824
<start> <start> <start> " my aunt ," she continued , " is going to - morrow into that part of the town , and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor - street ." <end> <end> <end>
2.643408133192392
<start> <start> <start> she wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen miss bingley . <end> <end> <end>
2.6062124433843894
<start> <start> <start> " i did not think caroline in spirits ," were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london . <end> <end> <end>
2.476855221445704
<start> <start> <start> i enquired after their brother , of course . <end> <end> <end>
2.550096388206161
<start> <start> <start> he was well , but so much engaged with mr . darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him . <end> <end> <end>
2.9215198558547106
<start> <start> <start> i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner . <end> <end> <end>
2.4865595012075556
<start> <start> <start> my visit was not long , as caroline and mrs . hurst were going out . <end> <end> <end>
2.4940963992489835
<start> <start> <start> i dare say i shall soon see them here ." <end> <end> <end>
2.30200280813225
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth shook her head over this letter . <end> <end> <end>
2.3458626552856052
<start> <start> <start> four weeks passed away , and jane saw nothing of him . <end> <end> <end>
2.533237372382108
<start> <start> <start> she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley ' s inattention . <end> <end> <end>
2.8417104949093157
<start> <start> <start> after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer . <end> <end> <end>
1.9929783365805056
<start> <start> <start> the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt . <end> <end> <end>
2.6082047453122756
<start> <start> <start> but , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if i still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . <end> <end> <end>
2.1374371458269943
<start> <start> <start> i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceived again . <end> <end> <end>
2.281989606575046
<start> <start> <start> caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did i receive in the mean time . <end> <end> <end>
1.9928194994973112
<start> <start> <start> when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . <end> <end> <end>
2.535922991188968
<start> <start> <start> she was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; i can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . <end> <end> <end>
2.134569801665312
<start> <start> <start> but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . <end> <end> <end>
2.27515701295161
<start> <start> <start> i need not explain myself farther ; and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable . <end> <end> <end>
2.143512532203206
<start> <start> <start> i cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . <end> <end> <end>
2.346903213386963
<start> <start> <start> he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy . <end> <end> <end>
2.618784150185324
<start> <start> <start> i cannot understand it . <end> <end> <end>
2.520441586900926
<start> <start> <start> if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . <end> <end> <end>
2.647319442273203
<start> <start> <start> let me hear from you very soon . <end> <end> <end>
2.3403292034528187
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . <end> <end> <end>
2.267475507355508
<start> <start> <start> we had better not mention it . <end> <end> <end>
2.3690095006286502
<start> <start> <start> i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford . <end> <end> <end>
2.1263287615586495
<start> <start> <start> pray go to see them , with sir william and maria . <end> <end> <end>
2.5487982016351416
<start> <start> <start> i am sure you will be very comfortable there . <end> <end> <end>
2.904657820481614
<start> <start> <start> " your ' s , & c ." this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least . <end> <end> <end>
2.1122581556837767
<start> <start> <start> all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . <end> <end> <end>
2.2268815412434546
<start> <start> <start> his character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr . darcy ' s sister , as , by wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away . <end> <end> <end>
2.560373572159009
<start> <start> <start> mrs . gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself . <end> <end> <end>
1.994851827773707
<start> <start> <start> his apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else . <end> <end> <end>
2.30819605920758
<start> <start> <start> her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . <end> <end> <end>
2.2819564609210716
<start> <start> <start> nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy . <end> <end> <end>
2.205477543015664
<start> <start> <start> all this was acknowledged to mrs . gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on :--" i am now convinced , my dear aunt , that i have never been much in love ; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . <end> <end> <end>
2.358736413462638
<start> <start> <start> but my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_ ; they are even impartial towards miss king . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . <end> <end> <end>
2.555870077091898

<start> <start> <start> after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , mr . collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself . <end> <end> <end>
2.4793077158605574
<start> <start> <start> to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible . <end> <end> <end>
1.9805999233172205
<start> <start> <start> but of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . <end> <end> <end>

2.035077483916116
<start> <start> <start> when mr . collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten . <end> <end> <end>
2.5252791379604678
<start> <start> <start> she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country . <end> <end> <end>
2.483184319703763
<start> <start> <start> it was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when mr . collins joining in , observed , " yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will be delighted with her . <end> <end> <end>
2.6153464863483706

2.6026793735562554
<start> <start> <start> the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . <end> <end> <end>
2.080858139285486
<start> <start> <start> a lively imagination soon settled it all . <end> <end> <end>
2.260515587401309
<start> <start> <start> about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . <end> <end> <end>
2.1235720833010894
<start> <start> <start> she opened the door , and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " oh , my dear eliza ! <end> <end> <end>

2.296288664461672
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth asked questions in vain ; maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining - room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . <end> <end> <end>
2.0878384286208274
<start> <start> <start> " and is this all ?" <end> <end> <end>

2.358966386157824
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and sir william , to elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way . <end> <end> <end>
2.0575030994787658
<start> <start> <start> at length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . <end> <end> <end>
2.687205059338579

2.524927373495401

<start> <start> <start> while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner .-- such formidable accounts of her ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened maria lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at st . james ' s . <end> <end> <end>
2.205562054454359
<start> <start> <start> as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park .-- every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr . collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh . <end> <end> <end>
2.2923314953075526
<start> <start> <start> she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation . <end> <end> <end>
2.1579687793425473
<start> <start> <start> from the entrance hall , of which mr . collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti - chamber , to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and mrs . jenkinson were sitting .-- her ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as mrs . collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . <end> <end> <end>
2.480380487044288
<start> <start> <start> in spite of having been at st . james ' s , sir william was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . <end> <end> <end>
2.287696811770317
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly .-- lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly - marked features , which might once have been handsome . <end> <end> <end>
1.971989891099258
<start> <start> <start> her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . <end> <end> <end>
2.3505078180961805
<start> <start> <start> there was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies . <end> <end> <end>
1.9819846082484027
<start> <start> <start> after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , mr . collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer . <end> <end> <end>
2.4766903951871155
<start> <start> <start> the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which mr . collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater .-- he carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear . <end> <end> <end>
2.223576056533187
<start> <start> <start> but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them . <end> <end> <end>
1.958689722152851
<start> <start> <start> the party did not supply much conversation . <end> <end> <end>
2.2182324118678305
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time . <end> <end> <end>
2.3355831921095542
<start> <start> <start> mrs . jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed . <end> <end> <end>
1.9008559674048786
<start> <start> <start> maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . <end> <end> <end>
2.73417797749492
<start> <start> <start> when the ladies returned to the drawing - room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted . <end> <end> <end>
2.35410786863273
<start> <start> <start> she enquired into charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her ' s , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry . <end> <end> <end>
2.2709362949065866
<start> <start> <start> she asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s maiden name ?-- elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly .-- lady catherine then observed , " your father ' s estate is entailed on mr . collins , i think . <end> <end> <end>
2.245707600660049
<start> <start> <start> for your sake ," turning to charlotte , " i am glad of it ; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line .-- it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh ' s family .-- do you play and sing , miss bennet ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.3720531816004913
<start> <start> <start> " a little ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5363859837885303
<start> <start> <start> then -- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . <end> <end> <end>
2.373923427511732
<start> <start> <start> our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to ---- you shall try it some day .-- do your sisters play and sing ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.7972722508883359
<start> <start> <start> " one of them does ." <end> <end> <end>
2.6689250667201145
<start> <start> <start> " why did not you all learn ?-- you ought all to have learned . <end> <end> <end>
2.0972653085240163
<start> <start> <start> the miss webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s .-- do you draw ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.1925937879958637
<start> <start> <start> " no , not at all ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5144064516671283
<start> <start> <start> " what , none of you ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.2955447275096077
<start> <start> <start> " not one ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5365134042266333
<start> <start> <start> " that is very strange . <end> <end> <end>
2.348885809169502

2.6716553930113394
<start> <start> <start> your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9661792524741832
<start> <start> <start> " my mother would have had no objection , but my father hates london ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3554315934459495
<start> <start> <start> " has your governess left you ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.2085722517618374
<start> <start> <start> " we never had any governess ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " no governess ! <end> <end> <end>
2.4372309635373397
<start> <start> <start> how was that possible ? <end> <end> <end>
2.449528493593953
<start> <start> <start> five daughters brought up at home without a governess !-- i never heard of such a thing . <end> <end> <end>
2.421244792207788

<start> <start> <start> " then , who taught you ? <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> who attended to you ? <end> <end> <end>
2.547788644150731
<start> <start> <start> " compared with some families , i believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means . <end> <end> <end>
2.027843440906045
<start> <start> <start> we were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . <end> <end> <end>
2.377391649916821
<start> <start> <start> those who chose to be idle , certainly might ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2886649841953326
<start> <start> <start> " aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if i had known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . <end> <end> <end>
2.333988695546048
<start> <start> <start> i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . <end> <end> <end>
1.968115104352883
<start> <start> <start> i am always glad to get a young person well placed out . <end> <end> <end>
2.1141685672620776
<start> <start> <start> four nieces of mrs . jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that i recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . <end> <end> <end>
2.6087279624834534
<start> <start> <start> mrs . collins , did i tell you of lady metcalfe ' s calling yesterday to thank me ? <end> <end> <end>
2.1282907733177754
<start> <start> <start> are any of your younger sisters out , miss bennet ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.4024726577959434
<start> <start> <start> " all !-- what , all five out at once ? <end> <end> <end>
2.0786089575228486
<start> <start> <start> very odd !-- and you only the second .-- the younger ones out before the elder are married !-- your younger sisters must be very young ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.0599657263885938
<start> <start> <start> " yes , my youngest is not sixteen . <end> <end> <end>
2.1237438219764306
<start> <start> <start> and to be kept back on _such_ a motive !-- i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2259166373247954
<start> <start> <start> " upon my word ," said her ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .-- pray , what is your age ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.2498190002955254
<start> <start> <start> " with three younger sisters grown up ," replied elizabeth smiling , " your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2013117254024053
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . <end> <end> <end>
2.1981440060464075
<start> <start> <start> " you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure ,-- therefore you need not conceal your age ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3511782672561066
<start> <start> <start> " i am not one and twenty ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2999071432031455
<start> <start> <start> when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed . <end> <end> <end>
2.375554708707614
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine , sir william , and mr . and mrs . collins sat down to quadrille ; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs . jenkinson to make up her party . <end> <end> <end>
2.6237853990564877
<start> <start> <start> their table was superlatively stupid . <end> <end> <end>
2.2481094194633853
<start> <start> <start> a great deal more passed at the other table . <end> <end> <end>
2.690367976207463
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine was generally speaking -- stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . <end> <end> <end>
1.8538590139291418
<start> <start> <start> sir william did not say much . <end> <end> <end>
2.382046140943553
<start> <start> <start> he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names . <end> <end> <end>
1.9352368004092915
<start> <start> <start> when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to mrs . collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . <end> <end> <end>
2.290733826857033
<start> <start> <start> the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow . <end> <end> <end>
2.1163774990647966
<start> <start> <start> from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr . collins ' s side , and as many bows on sir william ' s , they departed . <end> <end> <end>
2.5757774564721996
<start> <start> <start> as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . <end> <end> <end>
2.831993830774977
<start> <start> <start> but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy mr . collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship ' s praise into his own hands . <end> <end> <end>
2.3455941976171206
<start> <start> <start> chapter vii . <end> <end> <end>
2.2893520976531194
<start> <start> <start> while sir william was with them , mr . collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . <end> <end> <end>
2.2408796854696087
<start> <start> <start> the room in which the ladies sat was backwards . <end> <end> <end>
2.360488900954763
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining - parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr . collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement . <end> <end> <end>
2.268228525460309
<start> <start> <start> she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out . <end> <end> <end>
2.5474418378187167
<start> <start> <start> very few days passed in which mr . collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . <end> <end> <end>
2.4019201733846702
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr . collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty . <end> <end> <end>
1.8659778216663188
<start> <start> <start> the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first . <end> <end> <end>
2.237813001467603
<start> <start> <start> their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the collinses ' reach . <end> <end> <end>
2.0573181820799977
<start> <start> <start> this however was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . <end> <end> <end>
2.325984062132819
<start> <start> <start> her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine ' s curiosity . <end> <end> <end>
2.285770620228871
<start> <start> <start> in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . <end> <end> <end>
2.2110837840943334
<start> <start> <start> easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important . <end> <end> <end>
2.490930154147069
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr . darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.3291322618031827
<start> <start> <start> his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr . collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence . <end> <end> <end>
2.2641050106430494
<start> <start> <start> on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects . <end> <end> <end>
2.0973670346527302
<start> <start> <start> there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for mr . darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party , when mr . collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him . <end> <end> <end>
2.4768999750308343
<start> <start> <start> charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility . <end> <end> <end>
2.3167269166926423
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1030053799423842
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door - bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . <end> <end> <end>
1.8412198544200422
<start> <start> <start> colonel fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . <end> <end> <end>
2.0056900166600773
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to mrs . collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . <end> <end> <end>
2.344745143291058
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word . <end> <end> <end>
2.4558371318125998
<start> <start> <start> colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well - bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs . collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body . <end> <end> <end>
2.141436780458068
<start> <start> <start> at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family . <end> <end> <end>
2.2258525838149428
<start> <start> <start> she answered him in the usual way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , " my eldest sister has been in town these three months . <end> <end> <end>
2.5500741643233296
<start> <start> <start> have you never happened to see her there ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.544909919255298
<start> <start> <start> she was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet . <end> <end> <end>
2.559951376543402
<start> <start> <start> the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away . <end> <end> <end>
2.7003785363957213
<start> <start> <start> chapter viii . <end> <end> <end>
2.2893520976531194
<start> <start> <start> colonel fitzwilliam ' s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings . <end> <end> <end>
2.4382664737275683
<start> <start> <start> it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter - day , almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening . <end> <end> <end>
2.540297034130243
<start> <start> <start> for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter . <end> <end> <end>
2.31405714737215
<start> <start> <start> colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but mr . darcy they had only seen at church . <end> <end> <end>
2.686253838514439
<start> <start> <start> the invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine ' s drawing - room . <end> <end> <end>
2.3360922760175504
<start> <start> <start> her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.3736228298918673
<start> <start> <start> colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings ; and mrs . collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much . <end> <end> <end>
2.1546306261469415
<start> <start> <start> he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr . darcy . <end> <end> <end>
2.339651844691667
<start> <start> <start> _his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ? <end> <end> <end>
2.349423219870599
<start> <start> <start> what is it you are talking of ? <end> <end> <end>
2.3002200933295502
<start> <start> <start> what are you telling miss bennet ? <end> <end> <end>
2.4057055978013753
<start> <start> <start> let me hear what it is ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5488362219084864
<start> <start> <start> " we are speaking of music , madam ," said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . <end> <end> <end>
2.253524089783243
<start> <start> <start> " of music ! <end> <end> <end>
2.5769420533930134
<start> <start> <start> then pray speak aloud . <end> <end> <end>
2.411889200708906
<start> <start> <start> it is of all subjects my delight . <end> <end> <end>
2.1703452336332
<start> <start> <start> i must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . <end> <end> <end>
2.549098342707399
<start> <start> <start> there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . <end> <end> <end>
2.1776914450147795
<start> <start> <start> and so would anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . <end> <end> <end>
2.1260540752524957
<start> <start> <start> i am confident that she would have performed delightfully . <end> <end> <end>
2.5764171831543377
<start> <start> <start> how does georgiana get on , darcy ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.214253624640846
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s proficiency . <end> <end> <end>
2.725833123595483
<start> <start> <start> " i am very glad to hear such a good account of her ," said lady catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal ." <end> <end> <end>
2.504018546027234
<start> <start> <start> she practises very constantly ." <end> <end> <end>
2.361650029004566
<start> <start> <start> " so much the better . <end> <end> <end>
2.1102382827668187
<start> <start> <start> it cannot be done too much ; and when i next write to her , i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . <end> <end> <end>
2.5246738453376563
<start> <start> <start> i often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice . <end> <end> <end>
2.1286499904487894
<start> <start> <start> i have told miss bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though mrs . collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as i have often told her , to come to rosings every day , and play on the piano - forte in mrs . jenkinson ' s room . <end> <end> <end>
2.4539925264649445
<start> <start> <start> she would be in nobody ' s way , you know , in that part of the house ." <end> <end> <end>
2.8014400260312464
<start> <start> <start> he drew a chair near her . <end> <end> <end>
2.2491984012568693
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , " you mean to frighten me , mr . darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? <end> <end> <end>
2.475948640297732
<start> <start> <start> but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well . <end> <end> <end>
2.380098271450904
<start> <start> <start> there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . <end> <end> <end>
2.1013392870114584
<start> <start> <start> my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me ." <end> <end> <end>
2.018590622896535
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to colonel fitzwilliam , " your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word i say . <end> <end> <end>
2.6367160693611984
<start> <start> <start> i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . <end> <end> <end>
2.2354176092665785
<start> <start> <start> indeed , mr . darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear ." <end> <end> <end>
2.244040043068311
<start> <start> <start> " i am not afraid of you ," said he , smilingly . <end> <end> <end>
2.438889250016595
<start> <start> <start> " pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of ," cried colonel fitzwilliam . <end> <end> <end>
2.292129443573919
<start> <start> <start> " i should like to know how he behaves among strangers ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2447720590903857
<start> <start> <start> " you shall hear then -- but prepare yourself for something very dreadful . <end> <end> <end>
1.9837302975386228
<start> <start> <start> the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball -- and at this ball , what do you think he did ? <end> <end> <end>
2.574711940559517
<start> <start> <start> he danced only four dances ! <end> <end> <end>
2.227210431756945
<start> <start> <start> i am sorry to pain you -- but so it was . <end> <end> <end>
2.2618023392380278
<start> <start> <start> he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . <end> <end> <end>
2.0542995769049295
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy , you cannot deny the fact ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5461626024541073
<start> <start> <start> " i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3372422962456705
<start> <start> <start> " true ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room . <end> <end> <end>
2.0416384408643404
<start> <start> <start> well , colonel fitzwilliam , what do i play next ? <end> <end> <end>
2.4700373301847005
<start> <start> <start> " perhaps ," said darcy , " i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4736712155628213
<start> <start> <start> " shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.056679537046971
<start> <start> <start> said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam . <end> <end> <end>
2.6255453108596285
<start> <start> <start> " shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.2050197091363906
<start> <start> <start> " i can answer your question ," said fitzwilliam , " without applying to him . <end> <end> <end>
2.0545618975263875
<start> <start> <start> " i certainly have not the talent which some people possess ," said darcy , " of conversing easily with those i have never seen before . <end> <end> <end>
2.1617025811134143
<start> <start> <start> i cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1863368423970835
<start> <start> <start> " my fingers ," said elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women ' s do . <end> <end> <end>
1.9603274790411254
<start> <start> <start> but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because i would not take the trouble of practising . <end> <end> <end>
2.4691518495102174
<start> <start> <start> it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3064317551718325
<start> <start> <start> you have employed your time much better . <end> <end> <end>
2.212105900615
<start> <start> <start> no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting . <end> <end> <end>
2.125346413949019
<start> <start> <start> we neither of us perform to strangers ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1697779465240448
<start> <start> <start> here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . <end> <end> <end>
2.6339135281463517
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to darcy , " miss bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master . <end> <end> <end>
2.6993826097293554
<start> <start> <start> anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5145120432467576
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_ , had she been his relation . <end> <end> <end>
2.480153734217698
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth ' s performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste . <end> <end> <end>
1.9625681627551517
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home . <end> <end> <end>
2.4205137967110555
<start> <start> <start> chapter ix . <end> <end> <end>
2.2893520976531194
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while mrs . collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . <end> <end> <end>
2.3079158244140277
<start> <start> <start> as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half - finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr . darcy , and mr . darcy only , entered the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.483444672188247
<start> <start> <start> he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . <end> <end> <end>
2.1355035265948152
<start> <start> <start> they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . <end> <end> <end>
2.164282930137443
<start> <start> <start> it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr . darcy ! <end> <end> <end>
2.4931354408651236
<start> <start> <start> it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr . bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before . <end> <end> <end>
2.6427005409430286
<start> <start> <start> he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london ." <end> <end> <end>
3.254444864617089
<start> <start> <start> " perfectly so -- i thank you ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3825850640382567
<start> <start> <start> she found that she was to receive no other answer -- and , after a short pause , added , " i think i have understood that mr . bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.7716212793441195
<start> <start> <start> " i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . <end> <end> <end>
2.3834283769215103
<start> <start> <start> he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing ." <end> <end> <end>
2.323061094038837
<start> <start> <start> " if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . <end> <end> <end>
2.2148467630171904
<start> <start> <start> " i should not be surprised ," said darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers ." <end> <end> <end>
2.7296605514369463
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth made no answer . <end> <end> <end>
2.061847688349142
<start> <start> <start> she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . <end> <end> <end>
2.7097213648908336
<start> <start> <start> he took the hint , and soon began with , " this seems a very comfortable house . <end> <end> <end>
2.3942883613483024
<start> <start> <start> " i believe she did -- and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5151710011815376
<start> <start> <start> " mr . collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife ." <end> <end> <end>
2.476666560701116
<start> <start> <start> " yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . <end> <end> <end>
2.1547616139876142
<start> <start> <start> she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her ." <end> <end> <end>
2.759986441886954
<start> <start> <start> " it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5498537105132466
<start> <start> <start> " an easy distance do you call it ? <end> <end> <end>
2.2365312769130252
<start> <start> <start> it is nearly fifty miles ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2776340304154727
<start> <start> <start> " and what is fifty miles of good road ? <end> <end> <end>
2.1729644065097418
<start> <start> <start> little more than half a day ' s journey . <end> <end> <end>
2.598773483885515
<start> <start> <start> yes , i call it a _very_ easy distance ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3636715942054805
<start> <start> <start> " i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match ," cried elizabeth . <end> <end> <end>
2.2833338613001306
<start> <start> <start> " i should never have said mrs . collins was settled _near_ her family ." <end> <end> <end>
2.7459033126850176
<start> <start> <start> " it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire . <end> <end> <end>
2.462962722799861
<start> <start> <start> any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3003881014958023
<start> <start> <start> as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . <end> <end> <end>
2.6878700990841105
<start> <start> <start> the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . <end> <end> <end>
1.9548671946809848
<start> <start> <start> where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil . <end> <end> <end>
2.0759093108036133
<start> <start> <start> but that is not the case _here_ . <end> <end> <end>
2.8194118289955714
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " _you_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment . <end> <end> <end>
2.435994816941531
<start> <start> <start> _you_ cannot have been always at longbourn ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4945874753877266
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth looked surprised . <end> <end> <end>
2.526518215939157
<start> <start> <start> the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , " are you pleased with kent ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.2483157128636857
<start> <start> <start> a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise -- and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk . <end> <end> <end>
2.2849116151323123
<start> <start> <start> the tête - à - tête surprised them . <end> <end> <end>
2.0872843042319147
<start> <start> <start> " my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5940573698301375
<start> <start> <start> but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year . <end> <end> <end>
2.372758913507377
<start> <start> <start> within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day . <end> <end> <end>
2.3466161563386962
<start> <start> <start> they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt . <end> <end> <end>
2.1144182392192685
<start> <start> <start> it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . <end> <end> <end>
2.318980254937759
<start> <start> <start> but why mr . darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand . <end> <end> <end>
2.9343515360744346
<start> <start> <start> it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice -- a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself . <end> <end> <end>
2.159626580438718
<start> <start> <start> mrs . collins knew not what to make of him . <end> <end> <end>
2.4573472667107654
<start> <start> <start> he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable . <end> <end> <end>
2.623117137803258
<start> <start> <start> it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind . <end> <end> <end>
2.1763727108499435
<start> <start> <start> in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam . <end> <end> <end>
2.0135756070622435
<start> <start> <start> chapter x . more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.0437502555924874
<start> <start> <start> darcy .-- she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .-- how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd !-- yet it did , and even a third . <end> <end> <end>
2.0642742466443966
<start> <start> <start> it seemed like wilful ill - nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . <end> <end> <end>
2.0367850734661843
<start> <start> <start> he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr . and mrs . collins ' s happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too . <end> <end> <end>
2.314910575610276
<start> <start> <start> his words seemed to imply it . <end> <end> <end>
2.2350100228960983
<start> <start> <start> could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? <end> <end> <end>
2.147702422460157
<start> <start> <start> it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage . <end> <end> <end>
2.468005813225258
<start> <start> <start> she was engaged one day as she walked , in re - perusing jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr . darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her . <end> <end> <end>
2.2136439583219163

<start> <start> <start> " i have been making the tour of the park ," he replied , " as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> are you going much farther ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.3274290349000015
<start> <start> <start> and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together . <end> <end> <end>
2.457727190486207
<start> <start> <start> " do you certainly leave kent on saturday ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.1334437869462213

1.9103349749304153
<start> <start> <start> " is this ," thought elizabeth , " meant for me ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.4054126462352636
<start> <start> <start> and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " and pray , what is the usual price of an earl ' s younger son ? <end> <end> <end>
2.355106997985359

2.26127067863596

2.206908692225175
<start> <start> <start> as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth . <end> <end> <end>
2.295837093350177
<start> <start> <start> she directly replied , " you need not be frightened . <end> <end> <end>

2.71298168042204
<start> <start> <start> what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " he only told me , what i have now told you ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5627254465439564
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation . <end> <end> <end>
2.1572878832214366
<start> <start> <start> after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful . <end> <end> <end>
2.1697415353214637
<start> <start> <start> " i am thinking of what you have been telling me ," said she . <end> <end> <end>
2.6920150920285524
<start> <start> <start> " your cousin ' s conduct does not suit my feelings . <end> <end> <end>

2.655793732782382
<start> <start> <start> " that is not an unnatural surmise ," said fitzwilliam , " but it is lessening the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3770378067602445
<start> <start> <start> this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr . darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage . <end> <end> <end>
2.544595117943428
<start> <start> <start> there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . <end> <end> <end>
2.7922534763919757
<start> <start> <start> it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected . <end> <end> <end>
2.0484498583580195
<start> <start> <start> there could not exist in the world _two_ men , over whom mr . darcy could have such boundless influence . <end> <end> <end>
2.449514885096207
<start> <start> <start> that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr . bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . <end> <end> <end>
2.685048993176032
<start> <start> <start> if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , _he_ was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . <end> <end> <end>
2.3169978456866347
<start> <start> <start> he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted . <end> <end> <end>
2.043333042587699
<start> <start> <start> neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr . darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2089741434078394
<start> <start> <start> when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr . darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr . bingley for his sister . <end> <end> <end>
2.428988160582288
<start> <start> <start> the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr . darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . <end> <end> <end>
2.0832936316069217
<start> <start> <start> mrs . collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr . collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter xi . <end> <end> <end>
2.2893520976531194
<start> <start> <start> when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr . darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent . <end> <end> <end>
2.354089470740991
<start> <start> <start> they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . <end> <end> <end>
1.9502701946273424
<start> <start> <start> but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded . <end> <end> <end>
2.2532186910732586
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . <end> <end> <end>
2.186814627246726
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister ' s sufferings . <end> <end> <end>
2.415532879165972
<start> <start> <start> it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . <end> <end> <end>
2.147291896342456
<start> <start> <start> she could not think of darcy ' s leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him . <end> <end> <end>
2.604328785465293
<start> <start> <start> while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her . <end> <end> <end>
2.347836989177925
<start> <start> <start> in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . <end> <end> <end>
1.9565788248939835
<start> <start> <start> she answered him with cold civility . <end> <end> <end>
2.347664614346679
<start> <start> <start> he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.4273823209004988
<start> <start> <start> after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " in vain have i struggled . <end> <end> <end>
2.077386198021191
<start> <start> <start> my feelings will not be repressed . <end> <end> <end>
2.807058769879285
<start> <start> <start> you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2265793869116655
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression . <end> <end> <end>
2.4483594153328774
<start> <start> <start> she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . <end> <end> <end>
2.372234336560812
<start> <start> <start> this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed . <end> <end> <end>
2.7201903940273495
<start> <start> <start> he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . <end> <end> <end>
2.452337186855998
<start> <start> <start> his sense of her inferiority -- of its being a degradation -- of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit . <end> <end> <end>
1.9025723362288929
<start> <start> <start> in spite of her deeply - rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger . <end> <end> <end>
2.283474399821092
<start> <start> <start> she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . <end> <end> <end>
2.5620784185224257
<start> <start> <start> he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . <end> <end> <end>
2.326890768824346
<start> <start> <start> as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . <end> <end> <end>
2.848728008885002
<start> <start> <start> he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security . <end> <end> <end>
2.129699273421524
<start> <start> <start> such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . <end> <end> <end>
2.4306121052525587
<start> <start> <start> it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could _feel_ gratitude , i would now thank you . <end> <end> <end>
2.40092926725038
<start> <start> <start> but i cannot -- i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . <end> <end> <end>
2.4332468819822237
<start> <start> <start> i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one . <end> <end> <end>
2.3020540391804296
<start> <start> <start> it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration . <end> <end> <end>
2.8604328925750764
<start> <start> <start> the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation ." <end> <end> <end>
2.081139565017716
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy , who was leaning against the mantle - piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise . <end> <end> <end>
2.114327611694957
<start> <start> <start> his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature . <end> <end> <end>
2.269858163957072
<start> <start> <start> he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it . <end> <end> <end>
2.200127154827718
<start> <start> <start> the pause was to elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful . <end> <end> <end>
2.764667261627472
<start> <start> <start> at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting ! <end> <end> <end>
2.89591797177906
<start> <start> <start> i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _endeavour_ at civility , i am thus rejected . <end> <end> <end>
2.3493650573829625
<start> <start> <start> " i might as well enquire ," replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? <end> <end> <end>
2.055110573611448
<start> <start> <start> was not this some excuse for incivility , if i _was_ uncivil ? <end> <end> <end>
2.2495769191745407
<start> <start> <start> but i have other provocations . <end> <end> <end>
2.4129102978086
<start> <start> <start> you know i have . <end> <end> <end>
2.500795870354507
<start> <start> <start> as she pronounced these words , mr . darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued . <end> <end> <end>
2.3866468978061697
<start> <start> <start> " i have every reason in the world to think ill of you . <end> <end> <end>
2.449955164364001
<start> <start> <start> no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_ . <end> <end> <end>
1.8616332886493072
<start> <start> <start> you dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1337123283333668
<start> <start> <start> he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . <end> <end> <end>
2.5679124746060924
<start> <start> <start> " can you deny that you have done it ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.5801747015606766
<start> <start> <start> she repeated . <end> <end> <end>
2.688032530231712
<start> <start> <start> with assumed tranquillity he then replied , " i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success . <end> <end> <end>
2.4392505042942942
<start> <start> <start> " but it is not merely this affair ," she continued , " on which my dislike is founded . <end> <end> <end>
2.2030041369043425
<start> <start> <start> long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . <end> <end> <end>
2.3197692941455115
<start> <start> <start> your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr . wickham . <end> <end> <end>
2.258596797700862

2.1356474672567263
<start> <start> <start> " you take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns ," said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . <end> <end> <end>
2.2410511256685535
<start> <start> <start> " who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.9967429716934317
<start> <start> <start> " his misfortunes !" <end> <end> <end>
2.5558990135119277
<start> <start> <start> repeated darcy contemptuously ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed ." <end> <end> <end>
2.357589938101064
<start> <start> <start> " and of your infliction ," cried elizabeth with energy . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " you are mistaken , mr . darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2285418011053006
<start> <start> <start> she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground - work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! <end> <end> <end>
2.511840050324048

2.2893520976531194

2.5267765661626727

<start> <start> <start> she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being mr . darcy , she was directly retreating . <end> <end> <end>
2.3509915013639726
<start> <start> <start> she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr . darcy , she moved again towards the gate . <end> <end> <end>
2.4620733348271155
<start> <start> <start> he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . <end> <end> <end>
2.2475964765508154
<start> <start> <start> will you do me the honour of reading that letter ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.4345771826601856
<start> <start> <start> it was dated from rosings , at eight o ' clock in the morning , and was as follows :-- " be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you . <end> <end> <end>
2.112408334185717
<start> <start> <start> i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . <end> <end> <end>
2.3553042010481056
<start> <start> <start> you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice . <end> <end> <end>
2.185456083405195
<start> <start> <start> " two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge . <end> <end> <end>
2.227465944607659
<start> <start> <start> the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr . bingley from your sister ,-- and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.317656907424339
<start> <start> <start> wickham .-- wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .-- but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .-- if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your ' s , i can only say that i am sorry .-- the necessity must be obeyed -- and farther apology would be absurd .-- i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country .-- but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment .-- i had often seen him in love before .-- at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas ' s accidental information , that bingley ' s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . <end> <end> <end>
2.1864345871722026
<start> <start> <start> he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided . <end> <end> <end>
2.3952116567150723
<start> <start> <start> from that moment i observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively ; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him . <end> <end> <end>
2.3276811364305265
<start> <start> <start> your sister i also watched .-- her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening ' s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .-- if _you_ have not been mistaken here , _i_ must have been in an error . <end> <end> <end>
2.0386325733956068
<start> <start> <start> your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .-- if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . <end> <end> <end>
2.2824856922884997
<start> <start> <start> but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .-- that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain ,-- but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .-- i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ;-- i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason .-- my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .-- but there were other causes of repugnance ;-- causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .-- these causes must be stated , though briefly .-- the situation of your mother ' s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father .-- pardon me .-- it pains me to offend you . <end> <end> <end>
1.9477728634342868
<start> <start> <start> but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .-- i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection .-- he left netherfield for london , on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .-- the part which i acted , is now to be explained .-- his sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london .-- we accordingly went -- and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .-- i described , and enforced them earnestly .-- but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference . <end> <end> <end>
1.9252337998235662
<start> <start> <start> he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .-- but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .-- to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . <end> <end> <end>
2.1988109280693413
<start> <start> <start> there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ' s being in town . <end> <end> <end>
2.3510716230442896
<start> <start> <start> i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .-- that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ;-- but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .-- perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .-- it is done , however , and it was done for the best .-- on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . <end> <end> <end>
2.2590443214711518
<start> <start> <start> if i have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them .-- with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr . wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . <end> <end> <end>
2.2675089212310175
<start> <start> <start> of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity . <end> <end> <end>
2.2225911393974163
<start> <start> <start> mr . wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god - son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . <end> <end> <end>
2.407069824421552
<start> <start> <start> my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ;-- most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education . <end> <end> <end>
2.227616916936641
<start> <start> <start> my father was not only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . <end> <end> <end>
2.273200809884388
<start> <start> <start> as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner . <end> <end> <end>
2.7625399350552384
<start> <start> <start> the vicious propensities -- the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr . darcy could not have . <end> <end> <end>
2.3243096098495557
<start> <start> <start> here again i shall give you pain -- to what degree you only can tell . <end> <end> <end>
2.1879228015937886
<start> <start> <start> but whatever may be the sentiments which mr . wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character . <end> <end> <end>
2.1770834289471725
<start> <start> <start> it adds even another motive . <end> <end> <end>
2.2257185632227365
<start> <start> <start> my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr . wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant . <end> <end> <end>
2.2421587010981066
<start> <start> <start> he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein . <end> <end> <end>
2.407603507776296
<start> <start> <start> i knew that mr . wickham ought not to be a clergyman . <end> <end> <end>
3.6241116470007246
<start> <start> <start> the business was therefore soon settled . <end> <end> <end>
2.335177294896614
<start> <start> <start> all connection between us seemed now dissolved . <end> <end> <end>
2.155641157941476
<start> <start> <start> i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town . <end> <end> <end>
2.3929878941325446
<start> <start> <start> in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation . <end> <end> <end>
1.8705559011154231
<start> <start> <start> for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . <end> <end> <end>
2.2993981086887056
<start> <start> <start> his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . <end> <end> <end>
2.7278652770281075
<start> <start> <start> he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father ' s intentions . <end> <end> <end>
2.553768316043888
<start> <start> <start> you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it . <end> <end> <end>
1.9078741743105239
<start> <start> <start> his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself . <end> <end> <end>
1.9489636807658695
<start> <start> <start> after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt . <end> <end> <end>
2.1719301932372
<start> <start> <start> how he lived i know not . <end> <end> <end>
2.634417773692477
<start> <start> <start> i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . <end> <end> <end>
2.0201111174929953
<start> <start> <start> about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr . wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs . younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . <end> <end> <end>
2.0798354590530286
<start> <start> <start> i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . <end> <end> <end>
2.023726237054371
<start> <start> <start> you may imagine what i felt and how i acted . <end> <end> <end>
2.347413644522574
<start> <start> <start> regard for my sister ' s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr . wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs . younge was of course removed from her charge . <end> <end> <end>
2.507064818474657
<start> <start> <start> mr . wickham ' s chief object was unquestionably my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement . <end> <end> <end>
2.532149470884365
<start> <start> <start> his revenge would have been complete indeed . <end> <end> <end>
2.6930122709311535
<start> <start> <start> this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr . wickham . <end> <end> <end>
2.401861904897189
<start> <start> <start> i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . <end> <end> <end>
2.046705782057384
<start> <start> <start> ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . <end> <end> <end>
2.200100023144578
<start> <start> <start> you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . <end> <end> <end>
2.31061021305661
<start> <start> <start> for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father ' s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions . <end> <end> <end>
2.1429041677414573
<start> <start> <start> if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . <end> <end> <end>

2.7669498349545765
<start> <start> <start> but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited . <end> <end> <end>
2.381657872791809
<start> <start> <start> her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . <end> <end> <end>
2.2120139606154177
<start> <start> <start> with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . <end> <end> <end>
2.087274532756854
<start> <start> <start> with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield . <end> <end> <end>
2.2016453766263453
<start> <start> <start> she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . <end> <end> <end>
2.026140324308497
<start> <start> <start> his belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . <end> <end> <end>
2.3564002256689904
<start> <start> <start> he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty . <end> <end> <end>
2.112634549167801
<start> <start> <start> it was all pride and insolence . <end> <end> <end>
2.339905621023616
<start> <start> <start> but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr . wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition . <end> <end> <end>
2.0700824981840173
<start> <start> <start> she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " this must be false ! <end> <end> <end>
2.2940491872535236
<start> <start> <start> this must be the grossest falsehood !" <end> <end> <end>
2.5940303464507988
<start> <start> <start> -- and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . <end> <end> <end>
2.446996408588228
<start> <start> <start> in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . <end> <end> <end>
2.227387937683252
<start> <start> <start> the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr . darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . <end> <end> <end>
2.428092348556605
<start> <start> <start> so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great . <end> <end> <end>
2.1676867913978795
<start> <start> <start> what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . <end> <end> <end>
2.388685461535785
<start> <start> <start> but when she read , and re - read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham ' s resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . <end> <end> <end>
1.9897513563170521
<start> <start> <start> she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality -- deliberated on the probability of each statement -- but with little success . <end> <end> <end>
2.004368999226363
<start> <start> <start> on both sides it was only assertion . <end> <end> <end>
2.5043902644787424
<start> <start> <start> again she read on . <end> <end> <end>
2.542951665944716
<start> <start> <start> but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr . darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole . <end> <end> <end>
2.152011985415114
<start> <start> <start> she had never heard of him before his entrance into the ---- shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . <end> <end> <end>
2.3161666838481647
<start> <start> <start> as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring . <end> <end> <end>
2.850091891277016
<start> <start> <start> his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue . <end> <end> <end>
2.1096001859920888
<start> <start> <start> she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr . darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr . darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance . <end> <end> <end>
2.000693385719742
<start> <start> <start> but no such recollection befriended her . <end> <end> <end>
2.1854200011843288
<start> <start> <start> she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess . <end> <end> <end>
2.255655331412691
<start> <start> <start> after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . <end> <end> <end>
2.0858213147948366
<start> <start> <start> the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself -- from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question . <end> <end> <end>
2.111981628835969
<start> <start> <start> at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr . darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s corroboration . <end> <end> <end>
2.4998053357143477
<start> <start> <start> she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr . philips ' s . <end> <end> <end>
2.32408316233821
<start> <start> <start> many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . <end> <end> <end>
2.1293128954539013
<start> <start> <start> she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . <end> <end> <end>
2.5699239301694674
<start> <start> <start> she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr . darcy -- that mr . darcy might leave the country , but that _he_ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week . <end> <end> <end>
2.485587049089412
<start> <start> <start> she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr . darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son . <end> <end> <end>
2.269949856266252
<start> <start> <start> his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing . <end> <end> <end>
2.059603891286481
<start> <start> <start> his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn . <end> <end> <end>
1.9752779903929703
<start> <start> <start> every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of mr . darcy , she could not but allow that mr . bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust -- any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits . <end> <end> <end>
2.2135955962215537
<start> <start> <start> that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued -- that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling . <end> <end> <end>
2.0872293447670156
<start> <start> <start> that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr . bingley , was incomprehensible . <end> <end> <end>
2.423946943006939
<start> <start> <start> she grew absolutely ashamed of herself .-- of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd . <end> <end> <end>
1.9697314527486702
<start> <start> <start> " how despicably have i acted !" <end> <end> <end>
2.197701933404811
<start> <start> <start> she cried .--" i , who have prided myself on my discernment !-- i , who have valued myself on my abilities ! <end> <end> <end>
2.0513497057357326
<start> <start> <start> but vanity , not love , has been my folly .-- pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned . <end> <end> <end>
2.199074608764091
<start> <start> <start> till this moment , i never knew myself ." <end> <end> <end>
2.6555556151069246
<start> <start> <start> from herself to jane -- from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr . darcy ' s explanation _there_ , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . <end> <end> <end>
2.2636793364878325
<start> <start> <start> widely different was the effect of a second perusal .-- how could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ?-- he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister ' s attachment ;-- and she could not help remembering what charlotte ' s opinion had always been .-- neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane .-- she felt that jane ' s feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . <end> <end> <end>
2.2512924421915415
<start> <start> <start> when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe . <end> <end> <end>
2.285117417584049
<start> <start> <start> the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers . <end> <end> <end>
2.281315374784641
<start> <start> <start> it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self - attracted by the rest of her family ;-- and as she considered that jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before . <end> <end> <end>
2.184964164866335
<start> <start> <start> she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence ; mr . darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found .-- elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it . <end> <end> <end>
2.1543684400773513
<start> <start> <start> colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object . <end> <end> <end>
2.580898574617748
<start> <start> <start> chapter xiv . <end> <end> <end>
2.2893520976531194
<start> <start> <start> the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ; and mr . collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings . <end> <end> <end>
2.1376980923717697
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been . <end> <end> <end>
2.51544994788166
<start> <start> <start> " what would she have said ?-- how would she have behaved ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.0827160780938265
<start> <start> <start> were questions with which she amused herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.1942376546009017
<start> <start> <start> their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party .--" i assure you , i feel it exceedingly ," said lady catherine ; " i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do . <end> <end> <end>
2.3450577832651596
<start> <start> <start> but i am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me !-- they were excessively sorry to go ! <end> <end> <end>
2.232011909870819
<start> <start> <start> but so they always are . <end> <end> <end>
2.347304731467672
<start> <start> <start> the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more i think than last year . <end> <end> <end>
1.8125195544591601
<start> <start> <start> his attachment to rosings , certainly increases ." <end> <end> <end>
2.525787653797565
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " but if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . <end> <end> <end>
2.5810600430077018
<start> <start> <start> mrs . collins will be very glad of your company , i am sure ." <end> <end> <end>
2.7951209187258295
<start> <start> <start> " i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation ," replied elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it .-- i must be in town next saturday ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5506056524613054
<start> <start> <start> " why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . <end> <end> <end>
2.277885084921443
<start> <start> <start> i told mrs . collins so before you came . <end> <end> <end>
2.6438718340204446
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight ." <end> <end> <end>
2.107971092611048
<start> <start> <start> " but my father cannot .-- he wrote last week to hurry my return ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9892398593158032
<start> <start> <start> your father of course may spare you , if your mother can .-- daughters are never of so much consequence to a father . <end> <end> <end>
1.9356604461729743
<start> <start> <start> and if you will stay another _month_ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london , for i am going there early in june , for a week ; and as dawson does not object to the barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , i should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large ." <end> <end> <end>
2.519056357358067
<start> <start> <start> " you are all kindness , madam ; but i believe we must abide by our original plan ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2912525214109545
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine seemed resigned . <end> <end> <end>
2.426807618701619
<start> <start> <start> " mrs . collins , you must send a servant with them . <end> <end> <end>
3.0257736955875085
<start> <start> <start> you know i always speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . <end> <end> <end>
2.443448485033293
<start> <start> <start> you must contrive to send somebody . <end> <end> <end>
2.271486172722301
<start> <start> <start> i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing .-- young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . <end> <end> <end>
2.0794586390144136
<start> <start> <start> when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men servants go with her .-- miss darcy , the daughter of mr . darcy , of pemberley , and lady anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner .-- i am excessively attentive to all those things . <end> <end> <end>
2.2626154872003728
<start> <start> <start> you must send john with the young ladies , mrs . collins . <end> <end> <end>
3.0095462487433986
<start> <start> <start> " my uncle is to send a servant for us ." <end> <end> <end>
2.284345885330163
<start> <start> <start> " oh !-- your uncle !-- he keeps a man - servant , does he ?-- i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . <end> <end> <end>
1.8237129394154987
<start> <start> <start> where shall you change horses ?-- oh ! <end> <end> <end>
2.1357535393286264
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . <end> <end> <end>
2.2930513926221847
<start> <start> <start> reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . <end> <end> <end>
2.0423143799616965
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . <end> <end> <end>
2.623630914554407
<start> <start> <start> she studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different . <end> <end> <end>
2.010265816874435
<start> <start> <start> when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . <end> <end> <end>
2.157575418120019
<start> <start> <start> his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . <end> <end> <end>
2.1463684936786316
<start> <start> <start> in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin . <end> <end> <end>
2.2644678132099676
<start> <start> <start> they were hopeless of remedy . <end> <end> <end>
2.2816757061884516
<start> <start> <start> her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . <end> <end> <end>
2.066389027750956
<start> <start> <start> catherine , weak - spirited , irritable , and completely under lydia ' s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and lydia , self - willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing . <end> <end> <end>
2.045472378625374
<start> <start> <start> while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there for ever . <end> <end> <end>
2.3841411532991805
<start> <start> <start> anxiety on jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and mr . darcy ' s explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost . <end> <end> <end>
2.4062763858633147
<start> <start> <start> how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family ! <end> <end> <end>
2.1106309901203546
<start> <start> <start> when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . <end> <end> <end>
2.016911382636391
<start> <start> <start> their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first . <end> <end> <end>
2.5332585569237733
<start> <start> <start> the very last evening was spent there ; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh . <end> <end> <end>
2.1494395870915413
<start> <start> <start> when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year ; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both . <end> <end> <end>

2.2893520976531194
<start> <start> <start> on saturday morning elizabeth and mr . collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary . <end> <end> <end>
2.2952958804693098
<start> <start> <start> " i know not , miss elizabeth ," said he , " whether mrs . collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . <end> <end> <end>
2.5329986249711784
<start> <start> <start> the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you . <end> <end> <end>
2.1924078329580596
<start> <start> <start> our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2652056547598236
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . <end> <end> <end>
2.0932702688305005
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . <end> <end> <end>
2.4880500140062782
<start> <start> <start> we have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome . <end> <end> <end>
1.861417936743048
<start> <start> <start> our situation with regard to lady catherine ' s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> you see how continually we are engaged there . <end> <end> <end>
2.2468479728787636
<start> <start> <start> in truth i must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings ." <end> <end> <end>
2.141905173512731
<start> <start> <start> " you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire , my dear cousin . <end> <end> <end>

3.0420928731659354
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine ' s great attentions to mrs . collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate -- but on this point it will be as well to be silent . <end> <end> <end>

2.627534280839984
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> poor charlotte !-- it was melancholy to leave her to such society !-- but she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . <end> <end> <end>
2.3455524164426715

<start> <start> <start> after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr . collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to mr . and mrs . gardiner , though unknown . <end> <end> <end>
2.5903346008297707
<start> <start> <start> he then handed her in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings . <end> <end> <end>

2.494473653690346
<start> <start> <start> to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther . <end> <end> <end>

2.270422164554734
<start> <start> <start> these two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber . <end> <end> <end>
1.8223361688820252
<start> <start> <start> after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , " is not this nice ? <end> <end> <end>
1.8533355050901572

2.3628480092041384
<start> <start> <start> we dressed up chamberlayne in woman ' s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady ,-- only think what fun ! <end> <end> <end>
1.94332234228802

<start> <start> <start> i thought i should have died . <end> <end> <end>
2.518367863180812

2.366401792168548
<start> <start> <start> with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did lydia , assisted by kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn . <end> <end> <end>
1.895529477813705
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham ' s name . <end> <end> <end>
2.8111650379385122
<start> <start> <start> their reception at home was most kind . <end> <end> <end>
2.2832753260324345
<start> <start> <start> their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; mrs . bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger miss lucases ; and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her . <end> <end> <end>
2.2192973808760676
<start> <start> <start> as we went along , kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . <end> <end> <end>
2.235002076005498
<start> <start> <start> and then when we came away it was such fun ! <end> <end> <end>
2.3554088003520675
<start> <start> <start> i thought we never should have got into the coach . <end> <end> <end>
2.1740937606661546
<start> <start> <start> i was ready to die of laughter . <end> <end> <end>
2.3516861840962915
<start> <start> <start> we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off !" <end> <end> <end>
2.047338397769252
<start> <start> <start> to this , mary very gravely replied , " far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures . <end> <end> <end>
2.3235028856894098
<start> <start> <start> they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds . <end> <end> <end>
1.9730340389169658
<start> <start> <start> but i confess they would have no charms for _me_ . <end> <end> <end>
2.2682628150227324
<start> <start> <start> i should infinitely prefer a book ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2274061755334285
<start> <start> <start> but of this answer lydia heard not a word . <end> <end> <end>
2.3404415734603012
<start> <start> <start> she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all . <end> <end> <end>
2.257842894632996
<start> <start> <start> it should not be said , that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . <end> <end> <end>
3.252696473522693
<start> <start> <start> there was another reason too for her opposition . <end> <end> <end>
2.217841774266495
<start> <start> <start> she dreaded seeing wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . <end> <end> <end>
2.5749390122477736
<start> <start> <start> she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . <end> <end> <end>
2.3463044418922805
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter xvii . <end> <end> <end>
2.2893520976531194
<start> <start> <start> miss bennet ' s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . <end> <end> <end>
1.9666692040639238
<start> <start> <start> she was sorry that mr . darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him . <end> <end> <end>
2.1862034930146543
<start> <start> <start> " his being so sure of succeeding , was wrong ," said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1125865872908407
<start> <start> <start> " indeed ," replied elizabeth , " i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . <end> <end> <end>
2.477599183206931
<start> <start> <start> you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.8217010989941254
<start> <start> <start> " blame you ! <end> <end> <end>
2.477428138973479

2.1830437171922035
<start> <start> <start> " but you _will_ know it , when i have told you what happened the very next day ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5452389937536317
<start> <start> <start> she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham . <end> <end> <end>
2.4638642492667726
<start> <start> <start> what a stroke was this for poor jane ! <end> <end> <end>
2.0791712698446707
<start> <start> <start> nor was darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . <end> <end> <end>
2.438999458724256
<start> <start> <start> " this will not do ," said elizabeth . <end> <end> <end>
2.6527541590158745

<start> <start> <start> take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . <end> <end> <end>
2.8579344773657893
<start> <start> <start> there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much . <end> <end> <end>
2.0129862196835036
<start> <start> <start> for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr . darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse ." <end> <end> <end>

2.3576117971178445
<start> <start> <start> it is almost past belief . <end> <end> <end>

3.1109356946522144

<start> <start> <start> and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> jane was not happy . <end> <end> <end>
2.4611267884120034
<start> <start> <start> she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley . <end> <end> <end>
2.1085586920061767
<start> <start> <start> having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . <end> <end> <end>
2.0195027800746455
<start> <start> <start> " well , lizzy ," said mrs . bennet one day , " what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of jane ' s ? <end> <end> <end>

2.212448822140487
<start> <start> <start> such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn - house . <end> <end> <end>
2.082209841065178
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . <end> <end> <end>
2.0643371067803806
<start> <start> <start> but the gloom of lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from mrs . forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton . <end> <end> <end>
2.2073307475461235
<start> <start> <start> this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married . <end> <end> <end>
2.681411284703549
<start> <start> <start> the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs . forster , the delight of mrs . bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " i cannot see why mrs . forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia ," said she , " though i am _not_ her particular friend . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3181325025694925
<start> <start> <start> in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned . <end> <end> <end>
2.504552484416654
<start> <start> <start> as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death - warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go . <end> <end> <end>
2.1681355558195934
<start> <start> <start> she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs . forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home . <end> <end> <end>
2.270026230176847
<start> <start> <start> he heard her attentively , and then said , " lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances ." <end> <end> <end>
2.222698534837066

2.42765460140076

<start> <start> <start> excuse me -- for i must speak plainly . <end> <end> <end>
2.5017779195977132
<start> <start> <start> if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . <end> <end> <end>
2.647252638577509

<start> <start> <start> my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.4117132794848573
<start> <start> <start> mr . bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " do not make yourself uneasy , my love . <end> <end> <end>
2.25485016099543
<start> <start> <start> wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or i may say , three very silly sisters . <end> <end> <end>
2.256011682661714
<start> <start> <start> we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton . <end> <end> <end>

2.292297123761312
<start> <start> <start> at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . <end> <end> <end>
2.288718164143434
<start> <start> <start> the officers will find women better worth their notice . <end> <end> <end>
2.079713819429592
<start> <start> <start> at any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life ." <end> <end> <end>
2.034953965454205
<start> <start> <start> with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . <end> <end> <end>
2.4141951128267984
<start> <start> <start> it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them . <end> <end> <end>
2.311817461713218
<start> <start> <start> she was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition . <end> <end> <end>
2.0877903580789936
<start> <start> <start> had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility . <end> <end> <end>
2.124025203695017

<start> <start> <start> having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so . <end> <end> <end>
1.9003131622339633
<start> <start> <start> she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary . <end> <end> <end>
1.892254661773099
<start> <start> <start> in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . <end> <end> <end>
2.1555476184823252
<start> <start> <start> on the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in meryton , he dined with others of the officers at longbourn ; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam ' s and mr . darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former . <end> <end> <end>
2.325885387645033
<start> <start> <start> he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman - like man , asked her how she had liked him . <end> <end> <end>
2.3018075166455683
<start> <start> <start> her answer was warmly in his favour . <end> <end> <end>
2.4024946563291945
<start> <start> <start> with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " how long did you say that he was at rosings ?" <end> <end> <end>
3.0397727970709436
<start> <start> <start> " nearly three weeks ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3718235424388587
<start> <start> <start> " and you saw him frequently ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.386864474700516
<start> <start> <start> " yes , almost every day ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3441657322014415
<start> <start> <start> " his manners are very different from his cousin ' s ." <end> <end> <end>
2.60095519096542
<start> <start> <start> " yes , very different . <end> <end> <end>
2.307789431580054
<start> <start> <start> but i think mr . darcy improves on acquaintance ." <end> <end> <end>
2.8621738364809506
<start> <start> <start> " indeed !" <end> <end> <end>
2.409183171957269
<start> <start> <start> " and pray may i ask ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.438933412526744
<start> <start> <start> but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , " is it in address that he improves ? <end> <end> <end>
2.3841598540781264
<start> <start> <start> has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? <end> <end> <end>
2.0214452293014116
<start> <start> <start> for i dare not hope ," he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5869912877899237
<start> <start> <start> " oh , no !" <end> <end> <end>
2.4053170004441147
<start> <start> <start> said elizabeth . <end> <end> <end>
2.3732716189793788
<start> <start> <start> " in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was ." <end> <end> <end>
2.436597638731761
<start> <start> <start> there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , " when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood ." <end> <end> <end>
2.11193844599291
<start> <start> <start> wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , " you , who so well know my feelings towards mr . darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right . <end> <end> <end>
2.1992517796031836
<start> <start> <start> i only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . <end> <end> <end>
2.0821345815667183
<start> <start> <start> his fear of her , has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5655883719982175
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . <end> <end> <end>
2.2120857604391224
<start> <start> <start> she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . <end> <end> <end>
2.2800640647026484
<start> <start> <start> the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_ , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . <end> <end> <end>
2.1310832799022186
<start> <start> <start> when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs . forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning . <end> <end> <end>
2.401342031614974
<start> <start> <start> the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic . <end> <end> <end>
2.251545929766882
<start> <start> <start> kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy . <end> <end> <end>
2.329653244411569
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter xix . <end> <end> <end>
2.2893520976531194
<start> <start> <start> had elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort . <end> <end> <end>
2.441808308757375
<start> <start> <start> her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . <end> <end> <end>
2.0255909611258405
<start> <start> <start> but mr . bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . <end> <end> <end>
2.034519388164536
<start> <start> <start> he was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments . <end> <end> <end>
2.1355178080429376
<start> <start> <start> to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement . <end> <end> <end>
2.150556859109469
<start> <start> <start> this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given . <end> <end> <end>
1.906494639445431
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband . <end> <end> <end>
2.7622432687129708
<start> <start> <start> she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible . <end> <end> <end>
2.102761749924065
<start> <start> <start> their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp . <end> <end> <end>
1.8229753450628536
<start> <start> <start> upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.2857086976444236
<start> <start> <start> it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . <end> <end> <end>
1.9070048799642088
<start> <start> <start> her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . <end> <end> <end>
2.2044157209666824
<start> <start> <start> " but it is fortunate ," thought she , " that i have something to wish for . <end> <end> <end>
2.863693603416153
<start> <start> <start> were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . <end> <end> <end>
2.08953737982904
<start> <start> <start> but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister ' s absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized . <end> <end> <end>
2.0926122494750468
<start> <start> <start> a scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8429689910500988
<start> <start> <start> when lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short . <end> <end> <end>
2.2244659605771573
<start> <start> <start> those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs . forster called her , and they were going to the camp ;-- and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt -- for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public . <end> <end> <end>
2.4035685818267853
<start> <start> <start> after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re - appear at longbourn . <end> <end> <end>
1.9583020771417474
<start> <start> <start> everything wore a happier aspect . <end> <end> <end>
2.283274410175893
<start> <start> <start> the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . <end> <end> <end>
2.459179289266907
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war - office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton . <end> <end> <end>
1.9185475570039536
<start> <start> <start> the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs . gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent . <end> <end> <end>
2.098343270748505
<start> <start> <start> in that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to mrs . gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction . <end> <end> <end>
2.5659067632413994
<start> <start> <start> the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak . <end> <end> <end>
2.219502563436487
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough . <end> <end> <end>
2.077694541561159
<start> <start> <start> but it was her business to be satisfied -- and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . <end> <end> <end>
2.228866226333555
<start> <start> <start> with the mention of derbyshire , there were many ideas connected . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> the period of expectation was now doubled . <end> <end> <end>
2.3447482882579096
<start> <start> <start> four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival . <end> <end> <end>
2.3924304567790395
<start> <start> <start> but they did pass away , and mr . and mrs . gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn . <end> <end> <end>
2.3413810664793515
<start> <start> <start> the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way -- teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . <end> <end> <end>
1.9609713919876004
<start> <start> <start> the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement . <end> <end> <end>
2.19357172246695
<start> <start> <start> one enjoyment was certain -- that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences -- cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure -- and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad . <end> <end> <end>

2.3072153087014797
<start> <start> <start> to the little town of lambton , the scene of mrs . gardiner ' s former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of lambton , elizabeth found from her aunt , that pemberley was situated . <end> <end> <end>
2.0572975642495455
<start> <start> <start> it was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it . <end> <end> <end>
2.1541027112003714
<start> <start> <start> in talking over their route the evening before , mrs . gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again . <end> <end> <end>
2.475387944709273
<start> <start> <start> mr . gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . <end> <end> <end>
2.328081067009712
<start> <start> <start> " my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.4053921559373954
<start> <start> <start> said her aunt . <end> <end> <end>
2.870810151738085
<start> <start> <start> " a place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . <end> <end> <end>
2.1187676746719837
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was distressed . <end> <end> <end>
2.4849615648315733
<start> <start> <start> she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . <end> <end> <end>
2.902295470150389
<start> <start> <start> she must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains . <end> <end> <end>
1.9464913383100146
<start> <start> <start> " if it were merely a fine house richly furnished ," said she , " i should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> they have some of the finest woods in the country ." <end> <end> <end>
2.6543648953287295
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth said no more -- but her mind could not acquiesce . <end> <end> <end>
2.190414756421073
<start> <start> <start> the possibility of meeting mr . darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . <end> <end> <end>
2.7049770627227097
<start> <start> <start> accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer . <end> <end> <end>
2.1753787783232945
<start> <start> <start> a most welcome negative followed the last question -- and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . <end> <end> <end>

1.944452571452819
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view . <end> <end> <end>
2.04249110503319
<start> <start> <start> they gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound . <end> <end> <end>
1.9681970631244212
<start> <start> <start> it was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ;-- and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance . <end> <end> <end>

1.9689607242387448
<start> <start> <start> they were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of pemberley might be something ! <end> <end> <end>
2.2958205729305585
<start> <start> <start> they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was . <end> <end> <end>
2.587931893926567
<start> <start> <start> the housekeeper came ; a respectable - looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> this was a lucky recollection -- it saved her from something like regret . <end> <end> <end>
1.968181159871754
<start> <start> <start> she longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it . <end> <end> <end>
2.0272821030494135
<start> <start> <start> how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! <end> <end> <end>
1.9337910256009758
<start> <start> <start> her aunt now called her to look at a picture . <end> <end> <end>
2.3561438375023913
<start> <start> <start> she approached , and saw the likeness of mr . wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle - piece . <end> <end> <end>
2.2216276980478797
<start> <start> <start> her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . <end> <end> <end>
2.256696596441549
<start> <start> <start> the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence .--" he is now gone into the army ," she added , " but i am afraid he has turned out very wild ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3154606566338236
<start> <start> <start> mrs . gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it . <end> <end> <end>
2.607474842967157
<start> <start> <start> " and that ," said mrs . reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master -- and very like him . <end> <end> <end>
2.152592008911451
<start> <start> <start> it was drawn at the same time as the other -- about eight years ago ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1939531420665483
<start> <start> <start> " does that young lady know mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.404652251051913
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth coloured , and said --" a little ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4927487883830923
<start> <start> <start> " yes , very handsome ." <end> <end> <end>
2.241844736701204
<start> <start> <start> " i am sure _i_ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . <end> <end> <end>
1.9431787056628576
<start> <start> <start> this room was my late master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . <end> <end> <end>
2.1666109690370345
<start> <start> <start> this accounted to elizabeth for mr . wickham ' s being among them . <end> <end> <end>
2.8381669585992078
<start> <start> <start> said mr . gardiner . <end> <end> <end>
3.5672717203271906
<start> <start> <start> yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished !-- she plays and sings all day long . <end> <end> <end>
1.9414977185475035
<start> <start> <start> in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her -- a present from my master ; she comes here to - morrow with him ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9606625592467708
<start> <start> <start> mr . gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; mrs . reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . <end> <end> <end>
1.9328660533228634
<start> <start> <start> " is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.1831740466538103
<start> <start> <start> " not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months ." <end> <end> <end>
2.396440099552642
<start> <start> <start> " except ," thought elizabeth , " when she goes to ramsgate ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4547282934809838
<start> <start> <start> " if your master would marry , you might see more of him ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1704916367619944
<start> <start> <start> " yes , sir ; but i do not know when _that_ will be . <end> <end> <end>
2.530233363524661
<start> <start> <start> i do not know who is good enough for him ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3250228883789044
<start> <start> <start> mr . and mrs . gardiner smiled . <end> <end> <end>
2.7098211630295945
<start> <start> <start> " i say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him ," replied the other . <end> <end> <end>
2.267530900835581
<start> <start> <start> this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . <end> <end> <end>
2.003056389046157
<start> <start> <start> that he was not a good - tempered man , had been her firmest opinion . <end> <end> <end>
3.039861962442611
<start> <start> <start> you are lucky in having such a master ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2362473896134123
<start> <start> <start> " yes , sir , i know i am . <end> <end> <end>
2.8247762920898816
<start> <start> <start> but i have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest - tempered , most generous - hearted , boy in the world ." <end> <end> <end>
2.201925527537111
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth almost stared at her .--" can this be mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.1002965524829773
<start> <start> <start> thought she . <end> <end> <end>
2.8324715502890223
<start> <start> <start> " his father was an excellent man ," said mrs . gardiner . <end> <end> <end>
2.5485763130589745
<start> <start> <start> " yes , ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2006560533332755
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . <end> <end> <end>
2.247957056510816
<start> <start> <start> she related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain . <end> <end> <end>
2.379661759225023
<start> <start> <start> mr . gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . <end> <end> <end>
2.1282767746908893
<start> <start> <start> " he is the best landlord , and the best master ," said she , " that ever lived . <end> <end> <end>
2.7444569876415437
<start> <start> <start> not like the wild young men now - a - days , who think of nothing but themselves . <end> <end> <end>
2.0590445059024254
<start> <start> <start> there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . <end> <end> <end>
2.3206836761886858
<start> <start> <start> some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it . <end> <end> <end>
2.8923401362148216
<start> <start> <start> to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5926998001064083
<start> <start> <start> " in what an amiable light does this place him !" <end> <end> <end>
2.1622035360655203
<start> <start> <start> thought elizabeth . <end> <end> <end>
2.8097228312998435
<start> <start> <start> " this fine account of him ," whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5942286482994676
<start> <start> <start> " perhaps we might be deceived ." <end> <end> <end>
2.285133952860032
<start> <start> <start> " that is not very likely ; our authority was too good ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0875233632200816
<start> <start> <start> on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting - room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at pemberley . <end> <end> <end>
2.271537080961788
<start> <start> <start> " he is certainly a good brother ," said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . <end> <end> <end>
2.9695840064585393
<start> <start> <start> " and this is always the way with him ," she added .--" whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . <end> <end> <end>
2.2086926999065604
<start> <start> <start> there is nothing he would not do for her ." <end> <end> <end>
2.7812533735050256
<start> <start> <start> the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed - rooms , were all that remained to be shewn . <end> <end> <end>
2.1774398709977874
<start> <start> <start> in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy ' s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible . <end> <end> <end>
2.181898668975201
<start> <start> <start> in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger . <end> <end> <end>
2.2787153113378804
<start> <start> <start> at last it arrested her -- and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr . darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her . <end> <end> <end>
2.4852871780667134
<start> <start> <start> she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery . <end> <end> <end>
1.9596517196662266
<start> <start> <start> there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance . <end> <end> <end>
2.3532438281093127
<start> <start> <start> the commendation bestowed on him by mrs . reynolds was of no trifling nature . <end> <end> <end>
2.230079788694579
<start> <start> <start> as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship !-- how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow !-- how much of good or evil must be done by him ! <end> <end> <end>
2.1318873207326594
<start> <start> <start> every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . <end> <end> <end>
2.1019416044238355
<start> <start> <start> when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . <end> <end> <end>
2.0114176114443354
<start> <start> <start> as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables . <end> <end> <end>
2.050315188397848
<start> <start> <start> they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . <end> <end> <end>
2.5208832827127123
<start> <start> <start> their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . <end> <end> <end>
2.2501403832514804
<start> <start> <start> he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility . <end> <end> <end>
2.224548669632546
<start> <start> <start> she had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . <end> <end> <end>
2.009183409758203
<start> <start> <start> had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr . darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . <end> <end> <end>
1.9595733471010206
<start> <start> <start> they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family . <end> <end> <end>
1.9747615000794054
<start> <start> <start> amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life . <end> <end> <end>
2.1007212121606003
<start> <start> <start> nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts . <end> <end> <end>
2.249160390539078
<start> <start> <start> at length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave . <end> <end> <end>
2.4407262781380115
<start> <start> <start> the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . <end> <end> <end>
2.4882846708550406
<start> <start> <start> she was overpowered by shame and vexation . <end> <end> <end>
2.0964749956365933
<start> <start> <start> how strange must it appear to him ! <end> <end> <end>
2.26047899322765
<start> <start> <start> it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! <end> <end> <end>
2.220582445988135
<start> <start> <start> why did she come ? <end> <end> <end>
2.48274550442609
<start> <start> <start> or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? <end> <end> <end>
2.3480928247411827
<start> <start> <start> and his behaviour , so strikingly altered ,-- what could it mean ? <end> <end> <end>
2.03118231531291
<start> <start> <start> that he should even speak to her was amazing !-- but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! <end> <end> <end>
2.3415422984723047
<start> <start> <start> what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing ' s park , when he put his letter into her hand ! <end> <end> <end>
1.9826483015824838
<start> <start> <start> she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it . <end> <end> <end>
2.3968343220368395
<start> <start> <start> they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . <end> <end> <end>
2.1962082181768743
<start> <start> <start> her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr . darcy then was . <end> <end> <end>
2.4816114637454514
<start> <start> <start> she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him . <end> <end> <end>
2.6876433830537283
<start> <start> <start> perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _that_ in his voice , which was not like ease . <end> <end> <end>
2.3212048890460286
<start> <start> <start> whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . <end> <end> <end>
2.5803540503633844
<start> <start> <start> at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.4278909509155686
<start> <start> <start> they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream . <end> <end> <end>
1.9134220336559518
<start> <start> <start> mr . gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk . <end> <end> <end>
2.171758028530139
<start> <start> <start> it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts . <end> <end> <end>
2.160983235071581
<start> <start> <start> they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice - wood which bordered it . <end> <end> <end>
1.9381609540017475
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs . gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . <end> <end> <end>
2.237063170906101
<start> <start> <start> her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr . gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . <end> <end> <end>
2.3122789039259306
<start> <start> <start> whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr . darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . <end> <end> <end>
3.0638825613658884
<start> <start> <start> the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met . <end> <end> <end>
2.1875462179702283
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . <end> <end> <end>
2.2016744679686795
<start> <start> <start> for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . <end> <end> <end>
2.8520009186572737
<start> <start> <start> this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them . <end> <end> <end>
1.9766108305530028
<start> <start> <start> with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful ," and " charming ," when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed . <end> <end> <end>
2.3654065724845146
<start> <start> <start> mrs . gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . <end> <end> <end>
2.423576787430628
<start> <start> <start> this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.197372509256333
<start> <start> <start> " what will be his surprise ," thought she , " when he knows who they are ! <end> <end> <end>
2.2304888370849567
<start> <start> <start> he takes them now for people of fashion ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1411545893971837
<start> <start> <start> the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . <end> <end> <end>
2.508533917130521
<start> <start> <start> that he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr . gardiner . <end> <end> <end>
2.4196477345464795
<start> <start> <start> it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . <end> <end> <end>
2.4543149742760333
<start> <start> <start> she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners . <end> <end> <end>
2.182633092571029
<start> <start> <start> the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr . darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . <end> <end> <end>
2.2673270120131064
<start> <start> <start> mrs . gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder . <end> <end> <end>
2.0757930088827936
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.2216748918059137
<start> <start> <start> her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " why is he so altered ? <end> <end> <end>
2.2401651688463935
<start> <start> <start> from what can it proceed ? <end> <end> <end>
2.431026613053875
<start> <start> <start> it cannot be for _me_ , it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened . <end> <end> <end>
2.1667225844947042
<start> <start> <start> my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this . <end> <end> <end>
2.0478641817801884
<start> <start> <start> it is impossible that he should still love me ." <end> <end> <end>
2.554383804195344
<start> <start> <start> after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water - plant , there chanced to be a little alteration . <end> <end> <end>
2.1297843453654624
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together . <end> <end> <end>
2.588196659004508
<start> <start> <start> she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected --" for your housekeeper ," she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country ." <end> <end> <end>
2.371247653935051
<start> <start> <start> he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . <end> <end> <end>
2.3675402589557963
<start> <start> <start> " they will join me early to - morrow ," he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you ,-- mr . bingley and his sisters ." <end> <end> <end>
2.340164784140901
<start> <start> <start> her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr . bingley ' s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , _his_ mind was not very differently engaged . <end> <end> <end>
2.437039414686737
<start> <start> <start> " there is also one other person in the party ," he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you ,-- will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.9376323938316697
<start> <start> <start> the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it . <end> <end> <end>
2.38477194022811
<start> <start> <start> they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought . <end> <end> <end>
2.2264764304123874
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . <end> <end> <end>
2.3531386022836807
<start> <start> <start> his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind . <end> <end> <end>
2.766692233446307
<start> <start> <start> they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr . and mrs . gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . <end> <end> <end>
2.8039262022440243
<start> <start> <start> he then asked her to walk into the house -- but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . <end> <end> <end>
2.2017255089846453
<start> <start> <start> at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . <end> <end> <end>
2.3472586326218994
<start> <start> <start> she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject . <end> <end> <end>
2.2945759427711163
<start> <start> <start> at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance . <end> <end> <end>
2.568787467264735
<start> <start> <start> yet time and her aunt moved slowly -- and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête - à - tête was over . <end> <end> <end>
1.841521677336498
<start> <start> <start> on mr . and mrs . gardiner ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness . <end> <end> <end>
2.4461480935471394
<start> <start> <start> the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected . <end> <end> <end>
2.1749906341227696
<start> <start> <start> " he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming ," said her uncle . <end> <end> <end>
2.189681058856375
<start> <start> <start> " there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure ," replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . <end> <end> <end>
2.6047426764983777
<start> <start> <start> i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , _i_ have seen nothing of it ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0736500900184622
<start> <start> <start> " i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . <end> <end> <end>
2.385657933586354
<start> <start> <start> it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . <end> <end> <end>
2.5146299830542262
<start> <start> <start> his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling ." <end> <end> <end>
2.42962261720516
<start> <start> <start> " to be sure , lizzy ," said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as wickham ; or rather he has not wickham ' s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . <end> <end> <end>
2.754006885441302
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . <end> <end> <end>
2.6451127785246307
<start> <start> <start> " but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities ," replied her uncle . <end> <end> <end>
2.317449428371915
<start> <start> <start> " your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds ." <end> <end> <end>
2.146407595534971
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing . <end> <end> <end>
2.435619697213447
<start> <start> <start> " from what we have seen of him ," continued mrs . gardiner , " i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham . <end> <end> <end>
2.4531293601212822
<start> <start> <start> he has not an ill - natured look . <end> <end> <end>
2.5327325438946944
<start> <start> <start> and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . <end> <end> <end>
2.291006711078737
<start> <start> <start> i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . <end> <end> <end>
2.195352196528332
<start> <start> <start> but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue ." <end> <end> <end>
2.299865266338198
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire . <end> <end> <end>
2.437760881395997
<start> <start> <start> in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on . <end> <end> <end>
2.3131362843607897
<start> <start> <start> fatigued as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance . <end> <end> <end>
2.370254955379946
<start> <start> <start> the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr . darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . <end> <end> <end>
2.4126630568915015
<start> <start> <start> chapter ii . <end> <end> <end>
2.2877904988078965
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth had settled it that mr . darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . <end> <end> <end>
2.492520698932738
<start> <start> <start> they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street . <end> <end> <end>
2.2657862430320006
<start> <start> <start> her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . <end> <end> <end>
2.2481463625500595
<start> <start> <start> nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece . <end> <end> <end>
2.1628820565358247
<start> <start> <start> while these newly - born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing . <end> <end> <end>
2.0024382695547356
<start> <start> <start> she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . <end> <end> <end>
1.779899855138908
<start> <start> <start> she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse . <end> <end> <end>
2.2490565660790582
<start> <start> <start> miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . <end> <end> <end>
2.089281071212886
<start> <start> <start> with astonishment did elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.2910817434333204
<start> <start> <start> she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable . <end> <end> <end>
1.9833384197868975
<start> <start> <start> miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful . <end> <end> <end>
2.355999267234274
<start> <start> <start> she was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . <end> <end> <end>
2.454233950957024
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr . darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings . <end> <end> <end>
2.2203085929200315
<start> <start> <start> all elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again . <end> <end> <end>
2.210316669736552
<start> <start> <start> he enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good - humoured ease that he had ever done . <end> <end> <end>
2.4792668859882236
<start> <start> <start> to mr . and mrs . gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.278294627333369
<start> <start> <start> of the lady ' s sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough . <end> <end> <end>
2.0082593301938836
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . <end> <end> <end>
2.6988868995545783
<start> <start> <start> she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour . <end> <end> <end>
2.4180704167471028
<start> <start> <start> bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased . <end> <end> <end>
2.50549164642844
<start> <start> <start> in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! <end> <end> <end>
2.4564181951383555
<start> <start> <start> sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . <end> <end> <end>
2.2349460208853724
<start> <start> <start> but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival of jane . <end> <end> <end>
2.663903658572644
<start> <start> <start> no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . <end> <end> <end>
2.1503747250023046
<start> <start> <start> nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . <end> <end> <end>
2.2143547495060067
<start> <start> <start> on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . <end> <end> <end>
2.209615967233721
<start> <start> <start> he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ;" and , before she could reply , he added , " it is above eight months . <end> <end> <end>
2.6601932851149446
<start> <start> <start> we have not met since the 26th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0914345818598594
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn . <end> <end> <end>
2.1541395685721882
<start> <start> <start> there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . <end> <end> <end>
2.470830487601508
<start> <start> <start> it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr . darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day . <end> <end> <end>
2.204570202698197
<start> <start> <start> when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . <end> <end> <end>
2.064669150075383
<start> <start> <start> never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self - consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings . <end> <end> <end>
1.9804419030963036
<start> <start> <start> their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , mr . darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr . and mrs . gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country . <end> <end> <end>
2.6203771921728003
<start> <start> <start> miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed . <end> <end> <end>
2.2447517067763005
<start> <start> <start> presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . <end> <end> <end>
2.240962406432457
<start> <start> <start> bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends . <end> <end> <end>
2.471406545517683
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little . <end> <end> <end>
2.283845917930626
<start> <start> <start> eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress . <end> <end> <end>
2.2806492737809037
<start> <start> <start> but she had no reason to fear mr . and mrs . gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . <end> <end> <end>
2.7495124129493322
<start> <start> <start> it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr . darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . <end> <end> <end>
2.9954750887054966
<start> <start> <start> they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry . <end> <end> <end>
2.31610553270652
<start> <start> <start> of mr . darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . <end> <end> <end>
2.9786208065220157
<start> <start> <start> they could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for mr . darcy . <end> <end> <end>
2.481828807401004
<start> <start> <start> there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . <end> <end> <end>
2.327051350500043
<start> <start> <start> they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market - town , where the family did not visit . <end> <end> <end>
2.0499812809563966
<start> <start> <start> it was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor . <end> <end> <end>
2.8268114798861252
<start> <start> <start> with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr . darcy afterwards discharged . <end> <end> <end>
2.4862965816509175
<start> <start> <start> as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . <end> <end> <end>
2.3763953719699438
<start> <start> <start> no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . <end> <end> <end>
2.3009030697580144
<start> <start> <start> the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . <end> <end> <end>
1.9554153922805508
<start> <start> <start> but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked . <end> <end> <end>
2.3221870512879805
<start> <start> <start> it was gratitude .-- gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . <end> <end> <end>
1.9978112795872045
<start> <start> <start> he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . <end> <end> <end>
2.100141537616375
<start> <start> <start> such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude -- for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined . <end> <end> <end>
2.1878130626463625
<start> <start> <start> she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . <end> <end> <end>
2.3553185157423764
<start> <start> <start> it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning . <end> <end> <end>
2.4376613849801263
<start> <start> <start> they were , therefore , to go .-- elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . <end> <end> <end>
2.680442994280913
<start> <start> <start> mr . gardiner left them soon after breakfast . <end> <end> <end>
2.4233862669570727
<start> <start> <start> the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn . <end> <end> <end>
1.9405721118621744
<start> <start> <start> in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs . hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london . <end> <end> <end>
2.7495648230022676
<start> <start> <start> georgiana ' s reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> mrs . gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . <end> <end> <end>
2.365942036847529
<start> <start> <start> by mrs . hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . <end> <end> <end>
2.400840651315438
<start> <start> <start> it was first broken by mrs . annesley , a genteel , agreeable - looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs . gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . <end> <end> <end>
2.011355368233315
<start> <start> <start> miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . <end> <end> <end>
2.281378493906666
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention . <end> <end> <end>
2.9600788552666755
<start> <start> <start> her own thoughts were employing her . <end> <end> <end>
2.217979348854464
<start> <start> <start> she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.3027201611900887
<start> <start> <start> she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . <end> <end> <end>
2.207926150987788
<start> <start> <start> she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more . <end> <end> <end>
2.4836850135920505
<start> <start> <start> the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs . annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . <end> <end> <end>
2.0339072597152748
<start> <start> <start> while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr . darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came . <end> <end> <end>
2.293339535385337
<start> <start> <start> he had been some time with mr . gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning . <end> <end> <end>
2.6106812055098256
<start> <start> <start> no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ;-- a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.033524918189647
<start> <start> <start> in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr . darcy were by no means over . <end> <end> <end>
2.3656204824608476
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , " pray , miss eliza , are not the ---- shire militia removed from meryton ? <end> <end> <end>
2.3319236597727215
<start> <start> <start> they must be a great loss to _your_ family ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3930204927611953
<start> <start> <start> while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . <end> <end> <end>
2.148631120148717
<start> <start> <start> had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . <end> <end> <end>
2.2272431272799444
<start> <start> <start> not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy ' s meditated elopement . <end> <end> <end>
2.3089837769610413
<start> <start> <start> to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . <end> <end> <end>
2.2156089622547146
<start> <start> <start> he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . <end> <end> <end>
2.171418279609993
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . <end> <end> <end>
2.345923793391699
<start> <start> <start> their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above - mentioned ; and while mr . darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress . <end> <end> <end>
2.1713552407893495
<start> <start> <start> but georgiana would not join her . <end> <end> <end>
2.21159015613136
<start> <start> <start> when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . <end> <end> <end>
2.6212592974839377
<start> <start> <start> " how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr . darcy ," she cried ; " i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter . <end> <end> <end>
2.450651423574767
<start> <start> <start> she is grown so brown and coarse ! <end> <end> <end>
2.0496208516238674
<start> <start> <start> louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again ." <end> <end> <end>
2.407114577544889
<start> <start> <start> however little mr . darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned ,-- no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . <end> <end> <end>
1.9999091921333059
<start> <start> <start> " for my own part ," she rejoined , " i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her . <end> <end> <end>
2.3505970144019273
<start> <start> <start> her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . <end> <end> <end>
2.195365953004584
<start> <start> <start> her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them . <end> <end> <end>
2.384818184200957
<start> <start> <start> they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self - sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5397796168420776
<start> <start> <start> but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time ." <end> <end> <end>
2.356961943017989
<start> <start> <start> " yes ," replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but _that_ was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance ." <end> <end> <end>
2.414263080655477
<start> <start> <start> he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.6182777835707967
<start> <start> <start> mrs . gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . <end> <end> <end>
2.126100202732523
<start> <start> <start> the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention . <end> <end> <end>
2.0839784127789995
<start> <start> <start> they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs . gardiner thought of him , and mrs . gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ' s beginning the subject . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter iv . <end> <end> <end>
2.2893520976531194
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere . <end> <end> <end>
2.0924863392898008
<start> <start> <start> the one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . <end> <end> <end>
2.1271713670993995
<start> <start> <start> the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . <end> <end> <end>
2.006820619366178
<start> <start> <start> an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with wickham !-- imagine our surprise . <end> <end> <end>
2.1252892776957624
<start> <start> <start> to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . <end> <end> <end>
2.9295804211683865
<start> <start> <start> i am very , very sorry . <end> <end> <end>
2.6086340915081414
<start> <start> <start> thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart . <end> <end> <end>
1.8819011460296426
<start> <start> <start> his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . <end> <end> <end>
2.2937828227680557
<start> <start> <start> my father bears it better . <end> <end> <end>
2.311396448473147
<start> <start> <start> how thankful am i , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . <end> <end> <end>
2.028306216822174
<start> <start> <start> they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . <end> <end> <end>
1.8198334690136428
<start> <start> <start> the express was sent off directly . <end> <end> <end>

2.0890092378662954
<start> <start> <start> lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . <end> <end> <end>
2.293968502049675
<start> <start> <start> i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother . <end> <end> <end>
2.5540947601716324
<start> <start> <start> without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . <end> <end> <end>
2.172102632571995
<start> <start> <start> " by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent . <end> <end> <end>
2.1160594486067437

3.040979443221278
<start> <start> <start> imprudent as a marriage between mr . wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland . <end> <end> <end>
2.2010680726707172
<start> <start> <start> colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . <end> <end> <end>
2.147427315527195
<start> <start> <start> he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney - coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom . <end> <end> <end>
1.7063620963878845
<start> <start> <start> i know not what to think . <end> <end> <end>
2.685374654037375
<start> <start> <start> after making every possible enquiry on that side london , colonel f . came on into hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in barnet and hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through . <end> <end> <end>
1.9160170677168056
<start> <start> <start> with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . <end> <end> <end>

2.8774787191935842
<start> <start> <start> many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to every thing ?-- impossible . <end> <end> <end>
2.105897740000229
<start> <start> <start> i grieve to find , however , that colonel f . is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes , and said he feared w . was not a man to be trusted . <end> <end> <end>

2.198511924013886
<start> <start> <start> what he means to do , i am sure i know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to - morrow evening . <end> <end> <end>

2.300889647411447
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them . <end> <end> <end>
2.2729421155427727
<start> <start> <start> calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly . <end> <end> <end>
2.0524910318011815
<start> <start> <start> on his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , " let me call your maid . <end> <end> <end>
2.365720000849056

2.2093974050902103
<start> <start> <start> she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word . <end> <end> <end>
2.4607008490432833
<start> <start> <start> darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . <end> <end> <end>
2.063665467819209
<start> <start> <start> at length , she spoke again . <end> <end> <end>
2.458496891769252

<start> <start> <start> elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . <end> <end> <end>

1.9433975127630414

<start> <start> <start> this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to - day ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4429678936255663
<start> <start> <start> " oh , yes . <end> <end> <end>
2.2767388399006503
<start> <start> <start> be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy . <end> <end> <end>

2.40465393534811
<start> <start> <start> he readily assured her of his secrecy -- again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away . <end> <end> <end>
1.8213838030137917
<start> <start> <start> as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . <end> <end> <end>
2.002199715240254
<start> <start> <start> if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . <end> <end> <end>
2.0546579463483448
<start> <start> <start> but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill - success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . <end> <end> <end>
1.9585148555738845
<start> <start> <start> be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . <end> <end> <end>
2.1579901897066445
<start> <start> <start> never , since reading jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of wickham ' s meaning to marry her . <end> <end> <end>
2.443438362308469
<start> <start> <start> no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . <end> <end> <end>
2.6122929370577253
<start> <start> <start> surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement . <end> <end> <end>
2.7194324659763343
<start> <start> <start> while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise -- all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible . <end> <end> <end>
2.115021951077599
<start> <start> <start> but now it was all too natural . <end> <end> <end>
2.5232695754521193
<start> <start> <start> for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey . <end> <end> <end>
2.1598017633609694
<start> <start> <start> she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body . <end> <end> <end>
2.388864827182819
<start> <start> <start> sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion . <end> <end> <end>
1.9909760140484998
<start> <start> <start> her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object . <end> <end> <end>
2.0421964597967235
<start> <start> <start> the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl .-- oh ! <end> <end> <end>
1.8797327487229198
<start> <start> <start> how acutely did she now feel it . <end> <end> <end>
2.2204285835510165
<start> <start> <start> not lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , mr . gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .-- elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled . <end> <end> <end>
2.15076174715677
<start> <start> <start> they were to be off as soon as possible . <end> <end> <end>

1.9741519368320248
<start> <start> <start> had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure . <end> <end> <end>
2.1348450400266294
<start> <start> <start> an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr . gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn . <end> <end> <end>

2.444924620570527
<start> <start> <start> it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best . <end> <end> <end>
2.087440524090173

<start> <start> <start> but mr . gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters . <end> <end> <end>
2.433361382047716
<start> <start> <start> though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that _one_ only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of kitty . <end> <end> <end>
2.350064931859532
<start> <start> <start> then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable -- that one false step involves her in endless ruin -- that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful ,-- and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> but before they heard again from mr . gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr . collins ; which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . <end> <end> <end>
2.381812176993485
<start> <start> <start> it was as follows : " my dear sir , " i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire . <end> <end> <end>

2.7712483219374984
<start> <start> <start> and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs . bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . <end> <end> <end>
2.3586063963950554
<start> <start> <start> howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs . collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair . <end> <end> <end>
2.5793157361588066

<start> <start> <start> elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom . <end> <end> <end>
2.420615790260913

2.8060281580946693
<start> <start> <start> she felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> mr . bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him . <end> <end> <end>
2.477436993347703
<start> <start> <start> he now wished it more than ever . <end> <end> <end>
2.3504619656148176
<start> <start> <start> had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . <end> <end> <end>
1.9765280872215922
<start> <start> <start> the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place . <end> <end> <end>
2.2181883481288853
<start> <start> <start> he was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother - in - law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . <end> <end> <end>
2.3338710830933853
<start> <start> <start> this son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for . <end> <end> <end>
2.2809192722205993
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband ' s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income . <end> <end> <end>
2.148937639618386
<start> <start> <start> but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents . <end> <end> <end>
2.080380025595114
<start> <start> <start> this was one point , with regard to lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and mr . bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him . <end> <end> <end>
2.6330338844393206
<start> <start> <start> in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him . <end> <end> <end>
2.2215460616956735
<start> <start> <start> he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement . <end> <end> <end>
2.3020994329064814
<start> <start> <start> that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . <end> <end> <end>
2.315851321295307
<start> <start> <start> when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . <end> <end> <end>
1.9250902403946797
<start> <start> <start> his letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution . <end> <end> <end>
2.2847397869865853
<start> <start> <start> the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood . <end> <end> <end>
2.1783665104978294
<start> <start> <start> it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . <end> <end> <end>
2.1390451475737553
<start> <start> <start> to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house . <end> <end> <end>
2.479736678278329
<start> <start> <start> but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good - natured wishes for her well - doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain . <end> <end> <end>
2.0762026180549866
<start> <start> <start> it was a fortnight since mrs . bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high . <end> <end> <end>
2.400825253874809
<start> <start> <start> the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants . <end> <end> <end>
2.1597977776375625
<start> <start> <start> she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . <end> <end> <end>
2.037604455277292
<start> <start> <start> " haye - park might do ," said she , " if the gouldings would quit it , or the great house at stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but ashworth is too far off ! <end> <end> <end>
2.1218027683860234
<start> <start> <start> i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for purvis lodge , the attics are dreadful ." <end> <end> <end>
2.386951343462153
<start> <start> <start> her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained . <end> <end> <end>
2.2073797921576044
<start> <start> <start> but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " mrs . bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . <end> <end> <end>
2.461106641185758
<start> <start> <start> i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2571948450414356
<start> <start> <start> a long dispute followed this declaration ; but mr . bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and mrs . bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter . <end> <end> <end>
2.204544090169005
<start> <start> <start> he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion . <end> <end> <end>
2.322486593551855
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet could hardly comprehend it . <end> <end> <end>
2.253731336094494
<start> <start> <start> that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible . <end> <end> <end>
2.1069366932763014
<start> <start> <start> she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place . <end> <end> <end>
2.026242369204007
<start> <start> <start> she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means . <end> <end> <end>
2.2730656376377443
<start> <start> <start> there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s frailty would have mortified her so much . <end> <end> <end>
2.2888228263514954
<start> <start> <start> had lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr . darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned . <end> <end> <end>
2.223926984249165
<start> <start> <start> from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink . <end> <end> <end>
2.931115178017918
<start> <start> <start> the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this . <end> <end> <end>
2.277478602477888
<start> <start> <start> she was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what . <end> <end> <end>
2.412235217690028
<start> <start> <start> she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . <end> <end> <end>
2.534274890531809
<start> <start> <start> what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received ! <end> <end> <end>
2.2519108816118845
<start> <start> <start> he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . <end> <end> <end>
2.3225505548702
<start> <start> <start> but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . <end> <end> <end>
2.3854699417238607
<start> <start> <start> she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . <end> <end> <end>
2.256198375307883
<start> <start> <start> his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . <end> <end> <end>
2.3278444757930865
<start> <start> <start> it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance . <end> <end> <end>
2.2159483950930174
<start> <start> <start> but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was . <end> <end> <end>
1.7755106095052644
<start> <start> <start> an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family . <end> <end> <end>
2.2612909673439012
<start> <start> <start> how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine . <end> <end> <end>
2.60251783887057
<start> <start> <start> but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> * * * * * mr . gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . <end> <end> <end>
2.4231550979924332
<start> <start> <start> to mr . bennet ' s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . <end> <end> <end>
2.1558870831156085
<start> <start> <start> the principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that mr . wickham had resolved on quitting the militia . <end> <end> <end>
2.6000354388639613
<start> <start> <start> " it was greatly my wish that he should do so ," he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on . <end> <end> <end>

2.5069581025381136

2.5505714852685206
<start> <start> <start> but mrs . bennet , was not so well pleased with it . <end> <end> <end>
3.1251620408325866
<start> <start> <start> lydia ' s being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites . <end> <end> <end>
2.4097825431757314
<start> <start> <start> " she is so fond of mrs . forster ," said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! <end> <end> <end>

2.6986630952696284
<start> <start> <start> his daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative . <end> <end> <end>
2.2019752456732395
<start> <start> <start> but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . <end> <end> <end>
2.3696224970632054
<start> <start> <start> and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north . <end> <end> <end>
2.5926169780641506
<start> <start> <start> when mr . bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn . <end> <end> <end>
2.6431818115638825
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . <end> <end> <end>

2.6507173725231423
<start> <start> <start> their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets ; and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had _she_ been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> they came . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.3841290975237204
<start> <start> <start> her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness . <end> <end> <end>

3.111140365158486
<start> <start> <start> his countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips . <end> <end> <end>
2.2187575344900967
<start> <start> <start> the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him . <end> <end> <end>
2.686387335554288
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked . <end> <end> <end>
2.551586071816702
<start> <start> <start> lydia was lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless . <end> <end> <end>
1.7786977766426444
<start> <start> <start> wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . <end> <end> <end>
2.274925667666568
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man . <end> <end> <end>

2.50732658535168
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth looked expressively at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " oh ! <end> <end> <end>
2.2055970749106066
<start> <start> <start> mamma , do the people here abouts know i am married to - day ? <end> <end> <end>
2.2322494698059896
<start> <start> <start> i was afraid they might not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like any thing ." <end> <end> <end>
2.118957808327794
<start> <start> <start> she got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining - parlour . <end> <end> <end>
2.275408449086018
<start> <start> <start> she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " ah ! <end> <end> <end>
2.181457426885177
<start> <start> <start> jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5831963923223142
<start> <start> <start> it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first . <end> <end> <end>
2.3658710917289114
<start> <start> <start> her ease and good spirits increased . <end> <end> <end>
2.4065418897251605
<start> <start> <start> is not he a charming man ? <end> <end> <end>
2.639963498439273
<start> <start> <start> i only hope they may have half my good luck . <end> <end> <end>
2.1410810182414046
<start> <start> <start> they must all go to brighton . <end> <end> <end>
2.3945473831632267
<start> <start> <start> that is the place to get husbands . <end> <end> <end>
2.6799460405220827
<start> <start> <start> " very true ; and if i had my will , we should . <end> <end> <end>
2.562105576389664
<start> <start> <start> but my dear lydia , i don ' t at all like your going such a way off . <end> <end> <end>
2.2111428648094686
<start> <start> <start> must it be so ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.754820682274704
<start> <start> <start> " oh , lord ! <end> <end> <end>
2.1483329688801414
<start> <start> <start> i shall like it of all things . <end> <end> <end>
2.393402233496227
<start> <start> <start> we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5859484692559565
<start> <start> <start> " i should like it beyond any thing !" <end> <end> <end>
2.24241422402143
<start> <start> <start> said her mother . <end> <end> <end>
2.9018141490464724
<start> <start> <start> " and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2099794942946462
<start> <start> <start> " i thank you for my share of the favour ," said elizabeth ; " but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . <end> <end> <end>
2.168345411457747
<start> <start> <start> mr . wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight . <end> <end> <end>
2.6197179858607984
<start> <start> <start> no one but mrs . bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . <end> <end> <end>
2.374941245046327
<start> <start> <start> these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not . <end> <end> <end>
1.9987372627950724
<start> <start> <start> wickham ' s affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia ' s for him . <end> <end> <end>
2.7875372442958066
<start> <start> <start> lydia was exceedingly fond of him . <end> <end> <end>
2.2915195015916954
<start> <start> <start> he was her dear wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . <end> <end> <end>
2.1914560046779834
<start> <start> <start> you were not by , when i told mamma , and the others , all about it . <end> <end> <end>
2.899994649603562
<start> <start> <start> are not you curious to hear how it was managed ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.209414880022792
<start> <start> <start> " no really ," replied elizabeth ; " i think there cannot be too little said on the subject ." <end> <end> <end>
2.711387144986849
<start> <start> <start> " la ! <end> <end> <end>
2.4104992610572715
<start> <start> <start> but i must tell you how it went off . <end> <end> <end>
2.3203550807826687
<start> <start> <start> we were married , you know , at st . clement ' s , because wickham ' s lodgings were in that parish . <end> <end> <end>
2.691398975918447
<start> <start> <start> and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o ' clock . <end> <end> <end>
2.2931915095705944
<start> <start> <start> well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss ! <end> <end> <end>
3.2032622351441264
<start> <start> <start> i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted . <end> <end> <end>
2.5516492439601075
<start> <start> <start> and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . <end> <end> <end>
2.077424386595493
<start> <start> <start> however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham . <end> <end> <end>
2.6663584401083353
<start> <start> <start> i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . <end> <end> <end>
2.39110231214895
<start> <start> <start> " well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; i thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them . <end> <end> <end>
2.34178747594129
<start> <start> <start> if you ' ll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight . <end> <end> <end>
2.397282419380521
<start> <start> <start> to be sure london was rather thin , but however the little theatre was open . <end> <end> <end>
2.044064809119685
<start> <start> <start> well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr . stone . <end> <end> <end>
2.2624506560129563
<start> <start> <start> and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . <end> <end> <end>
2.7548610787889607
<start> <start> <start> well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day . <end> <end> <end>
2.8283065554261553
<start> <start> <start> but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . <end> <end> <end>
2.445294676307753
<start> <start> <start> " mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.72746312569518
<start> <start> <start> " oh , yes !-- he was to come there with wickham , you know . <end> <end> <end>
2.481238888230397
<start> <start> <start> but gracious me ! <end> <end> <end>
2.485317459026035
<start> <start> <start> i quite forgot ! <end> <end> <end>
2.4791346114917565
<start> <start> <start> i ought not to have said a word about it . <end> <end> <end>
2.378840920239195
<start> <start> <start> i promised them so faithfully ! <end> <end> <end>
2.246268148764818
<start> <start> <start> what will wickham say ? <end> <end> <end>
2.398380142406873
<start> <start> <start> it was to be such a secret !" <end> <end> <end>
2.892561498640792
<start> <start> <start> " if it was to be secret ," said jane , " say not another word on the subject . <end> <end> <end>
2.4698439158450123
<start> <start> <start> you may depend upon my seeking no further ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1797107897647967
<start> <start> <start> certainly ," said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3573095946742635
<start> <start> <start> " thank you ," said lydia , " for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry ." <end> <end> <end>
2.931037106677942
<start> <start> <start> on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . <end> <end> <end>
2.3199607380470306
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy had been at her sister ' s wedding . <end> <end> <end>
2.959350294767045
<start> <start> <start> it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . <end> <end> <end>
2.0218960970127955
<start> <start> <start> conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . <end> <end> <end>
2.6741282858162982
<start> <start> <start> those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable . <end> <end> <end>
2.0610597324490585
<start> <start> <start> she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . <end> <end> <end>
2.0244372841874037
<start> <start> <start> " you may readily comprehend ," she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . <end> <end> <end>
2.1547184260322436
<start> <start> <start> pray write instantly , and let me understand it -- unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1090852784207024
<start> <start> <start> " not that i _shall_ though ," she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out ." <end> <end> <end>
2.54950100962328
<start> <start> <start> jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ;-- till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . <end> <end> <end>
2.1006003504397617
<start> <start> <start> chapter x . elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could . <end> <end> <end>
2.2647455316150134
<start> <start> <start> she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . <end> <end> <end>
2.4230243686470043
<start> <start> <start> " gracechurch - street , sept . 6 . <end> <end> <end>
2.063397238612801
<start> <start> <start> " my dear niece , " i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you . <end> <end> <end>
2.3264023468002044
<start> <start> <start> i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from _you_ . <end> <end> <end>
2.2965417419936123
<start> <start> <start> don ' t think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_ side . <end> <end> <end>
2.525825468560272
<start> <start> <start> if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . <end> <end> <end>
2.216429648541956
<start> <start> <start> your uncle is as much surprised as i am -- and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done . <end> <end> <end>
2.2904692413343324
<start> <start> <start> but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit . <end> <end> <end>
2.5101014379812594
<start> <start> <start> on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . <end> <end> <end>
2.171340927020148
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . <end> <end> <end>
2.555395610100624
<start> <start> <start> it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _your ' s_ seems to have been . <end> <end> <end>
2.0770608149936276
<start> <start> <start> he came to tell mr . gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr . wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once . <end> <end> <end>
2.8611696863190157
<start> <start> <start> from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . <end> <end> <end>
1.948886811184912
<start> <start> <start> the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham ' s worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him . <end> <end> <end>
2.3025025949375135
<start> <start> <start> he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world . <end> <end> <end>
2.177210276953882
<start> <start> <start> his character was to speak for itself . <end> <end> <end>
2.3472057104664774
<start> <start> <start> he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _we_ had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us . <end> <end> <end>
2.5891673854872304
<start> <start> <start> there is a lady , it seems , a mrs . younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . <end> <end> <end>
2.6162022658478876
<start> <start> <start> she then took a large house in edward - street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . <end> <end> <end>
2.057317621811263
<start> <start> <start> this mrs . younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . <end> <end> <end>
2.559222001456973
<start> <start> <start> but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . <end> <end> <end>
2.3167449560519424
<start> <start> <start> she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . <end> <end> <end>
2.371774380009851
<start> <start> <start> wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . <end> <end> <end>
2.63083647291686
<start> <start> <start> at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished - for direction . <end> <end> <end>
2.131348025108999
<start> <start> <start> they were in ---- street . <end> <end> <end>
2.428365158913662
<start> <start> <start> he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia . <end> <end> <end>
2.403395717998424
<start> <start> <start> his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go . <end> <end> <end>
2.5228470278585924
<start> <start> <start> but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . <end> <end> <end>
2.113360524326465
<start> <start> <start> she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham . <end> <end> <end>
2.434519507939128
<start> <start> <start> she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . <end> <end> <end>
2.8541513563529484
<start> <start> <start> since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been _his_ design . <end> <end> <end>
2.2461833950014216
<start> <start> <start> he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill - consequences of lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone . <end> <end> <end>
2.0571839801928546
<start> <start> <start> he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . <end> <end> <end>
2.3800159133580387
<start> <start> <start> he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . <end> <end> <end>
3.063402103569598
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . <end> <end> <end>
2.3273081052088287
<start> <start> <start> but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . <end> <end> <end>
2.089397280035527
<start> <start> <start> under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . <end> <end> <end>
2.778754794737844
<start> <start> <start> every thing being settled between _them_ , mr . darcy ' s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch - street the evening before i came home . <end> <end> <end>
2.3886881324461227
<start> <start> <start> he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former . <end> <end> <end>
2.164730661385112
<start> <start> <start> he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . <end> <end> <end>
2.6232521153804904
<start> <start> <start> on saturday he came again . <end> <end> <end>
2.38765178792988
<start> <start> <start> your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together . <end> <end> <end>
2.959784637053821
<start> <start> <start> they met again on sunday , and then _i_ saw him too . <end> <end> <end>
2.4851546941579734
<start> <start> <start> it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn . <end> <end> <end>
2.3192092141718215
<start> <start> <start> but our visitor was very obstinate . <end> <end> <end>
2.2498447971890507
<start> <start> <start> i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all . <end> <end> <end>
2.2855723245175144
<start> <start> <start> nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . <end> <end> <end>
2.6147254734669567
<start> <start> <start> they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . <end> <end> <end>
2.1170552901058413
<start> <start> <start> but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most . <end> <end> <end>
2.1897428163409924
<start> <start> <start> you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people . <end> <end> <end>
2.689438426488968
<start> <start> <start> his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_ , and his commission purchased . <end> <end> <end>
2.31925235385825
<start> <start> <start> the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above . <end> <end> <end>
2.681693005551067
<start> <start> <start> it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . <end> <end> <end>
2.688534018681055
<start> <start> <start> perhaps there was some truth in _this_ ; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve , or _anybody ' s_ reserve , can be answerable for the event . <end> <end> <end>
1.8940503641891038

<start> <start> <start> when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . <end> <end> <end>

2.3761674083475723
<start> <start> <start> his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _that_ , if he marry _prudently_ , his wife may teach him . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr . darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! <end> <end> <end>
2.1585805750812006
<start> <start> <start> he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham . <end> <end> <end>

2.0237368588387774
<start> <start> <start> it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " no , no . <end> <end> <end>
2.4734815563410604
<start> <start> <start> you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . <end> <end> <end>
2.345954524069182
<start> <start> <start> but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool ' s errand again ." <end> <end> <end>
2.453815006120829
<start> <start> <start> " if he wants our society , let him seek it . <end> <end> <end>
2.0531160443923118
<start> <start> <start> i will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0830618245591643
<start> <start> <start> " well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . <end> <end> <end>
2.6362208031622743
<start> <start> <start> but , however , that shan ' t prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined . <end> <end> <end>
2.489282903737721
<start> <start> <start> we must have mrs . long and the gouldings soon . <end> <end> <end>
2.421674395085907
<start> <start> <start> consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr . bingley in consequence of it , before _they_ did . <end> <end> <end>
2.5340827837663156
<start> <start> <start> as the day of his arrival drew near , " i begin to be sorry that he comes at all ," said jane to her sister . <end> <end> <end>
2.7492996962942158
<start> <start> <start> " it would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . <end> <end> <end>
2.649386211490867
<start> <start> <start> my mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much i suffer from what she says . <end> <end> <end>
2.7057603732993862
<start> <start> <start> happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over !" <end> <end> <end>
2.116982195165509
<start> <start> <start> " i wish i could say any thing to comfort you ," replied elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power . <end> <end> <end>
2.4780308758397567
<start> <start> <start> you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much ." <end> <end> <end>
2.384668929613334
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley arrived . <end> <end> <end>
2.691969069738854
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could . <end> <end> <end>
2.484032690227481
<start> <start> <start> she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before . <end> <end> <end>
1.9577970995252596
<start> <start> <start> but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing - room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house . <end> <end> <end>
2.2663209906596005
<start> <start> <start> her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . <end> <end> <end>
2.0637190209363188
<start> <start> <start> jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window -- she looked ,-- she saw mr . darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . <end> <end> <end>
2.642711455500004
<start> <start> <start> " there is a gentleman with him , mamma ," said kitty ; " who can it be ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.437088501666253
<start> <start> <start> " la !" <end> <end> <end>
2.608163496598671
<start> <start> <start> replied kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . <end> <end> <end>
2.2981721450756463
<start> <start> <start> mr . what ' s his name . <end> <end> <end>
2.112014950509985
<start> <start> <start> that tall , proud man ." <end> <end> <end>
2.297749689238262
<start> <start> <start> darcy !-- and so it does i vow . <end> <end> <end>
2.186393329022701
<start> <start> <start> jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern . <end> <end> <end>
2.1756049037065686
<start> <start> <start> she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter . <end> <end> <end>
2.1729259102827356
<start> <start> <start> both sisters were uncomfortable enough . <end> <end> <end>
2.349770993623002
<start> <start> <start> each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr . darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr . bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them . <end> <end> <end>
2.91929775870012
<start> <start> <start> but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs . gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . <end> <end> <end>
2.5428411877090933
<start> <start> <start> to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley . <end> <end> <end>
2.279183500135645
<start> <start> <start> the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken . <end> <end> <end>
2.2500402162115063
<start> <start> <start> but she would not be secure . <end> <end> <end>
2.885726225142755
<start> <start> <start> " let me first see how he behaves ," said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation ." <end> <end> <end>
2.35388796254627
<start> <start> <start> jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected . <end> <end> <end>
2.1571990535617718
<start> <start> <start> on the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . <end> <end> <end>
2.0484325148994382
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . <end> <end> <end>
2.2685958586499195
<start> <start> <start> she had ventured only one glance at darcy . <end> <end> <end>
2.115080453439655
<start> <start> <start> he looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley . <end> <end> <end>
2.785373830953689
<start> <start> <start> but , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . <end> <end> <end>
2.7037874761383507
<start> <start> <start> it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture . <end> <end> <end>
2.30533846486406
<start> <start> <start> bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . <end> <end> <end>
2.2724075273162265
<start> <start> <start> he was received by mrs . bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend . <end> <end> <end>
2.1223525567907955
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied . <end> <end> <end>
1.905400938769352
<start> <start> <start> there he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.787661709154838
<start> <start> <start> but now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . <end> <end> <end>
1.9458600977726723
<start> <start> <start> more thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed . <end> <end> <end>
2.0384934835925628
<start> <start> <start> she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so . <end> <end> <end>
2.106257151705729
<start> <start> <start> " could i expect it to be otherwise !" <end> <end> <end>
2.6706056530538085
<start> <start> <start> said she . <end> <end> <end>
2.3540326336378494
<start> <start> <start> " yet why did he come ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.4525981740733274
<start> <start> <start> she enquired after his sister , but could do no more . <end> <end> <end>
2.5413177267106004
<start> <start> <start> he readily agreed to it . <end> <end> <end>
2.4611283365349363
<start> <start> <start> people _did_ say , you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true . <end> <end> <end>
2.7472123536142257
<start> <start> <start> a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . <end> <end> <end>
2.355680691398077
<start> <start> <start> miss lucas is married and settled . <end> <end> <end>

3.0590968458960046
<start> <start> <start> it was in the times and the courier , i know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . <end> <end> <end>
2.5922704835719386
<start> <start> <start> to miss lydia bennet ,' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . <end> <end> <end>
2.5352892909404097
<start> <start> <start> it was my brother gardiner ' s drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . <end> <end> <end>
2.403271980610506
<start> <start> <start> did you see it ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.50830307677462
<start> <start> <start> bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . <end> <end> <end>
2.7508621508308186
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes . <end> <end> <end>
2.08775279564978
<start> <start> <start> how mr . darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . <end> <end> <end>
3.709578929708452
<start> <start> <start> " it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married ," continued her mother , " but at the same time , mr . bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . <end> <end> <end>
2.957367302007283
<start> <start> <start> his regiment is there ; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the ---- shire , and of his being gone into the regulars . <end> <end> <end>
2.6702355834457863
<start> <start> <start> he has _some_ friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0904274672377943
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr . darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . <end> <end> <end>
2.6068515082120394
<start> <start> <start> it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . <end> <end> <end>
2.5633357282387497
<start> <start> <start> a few weeks , he believed . <end> <end> <end>
2.555299787412995
<start> <start> <start> " when you have killed all your own birds , mr . bingley ," said her mother , " i beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on mr . bennet ' s manor . <end> <end> <end>
2.8003842061582134
<start> <start> <start> i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4007728951145366
<start> <start> <start> were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion . <end> <end> <end>
2.3191449722185755
<start> <start> <start> at that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion . <end> <end> <end>
1.9612279660001561
<start> <start> <start> " the first wish of my heart ," said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them . <end> <end> <end>
2.7490423342303276
<start> <start> <start> their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! <end> <end> <end>
1.969882360211401
<start> <start> <start> let me never see either one or the other again !" <end> <end> <end>
2.204937162641507
<start> <start> <start> when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . <end> <end> <end>
2.1458707272155992
<start> <start> <start> jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever . <end> <end> <end>
2.4398052176459832
<start> <start> <start> when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs . bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time . <end> <end> <end>
2.613278558536921
<start> <start> <start> " you are quite a visit in my debt , mr . bingley ," she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned . <end> <end> <end>
2.5141030976604766
<start> <start> <start> i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement ." <end> <end> <end>
2.6438287974807646
<start> <start> <start> bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business . <end> <end> <end>
2.1975866290728256
<start> <start> <start> they then went away . <end> <end> <end>
2.52939034422065
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a - year . <end> <end> <end>

2.2893520976531194
<start> <start> <start> as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more . <end> <end> <end>
1.8548763461090692
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her . <end> <end> <end>
2.3253540172308718
<start> <start> <start> " why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent ," said she , " did he come at all ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.4625051913787552
<start> <start> <start> she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . <end> <end> <end>
2.0382961277173357
<start> <start> <start> " he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> i will think no more about him ." <end> <end> <end>
2.402416612345813
<start> <start> <start> her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth . <end> <end> <end>
2.1894457535695206
<start> <start> <start> " now ," said she , " that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy . <end> <end> <end>
2.428965648665733

<start> <start> <start> i am glad he dines here on tuesday . <end> <end> <end>
2.137722067584309
<start> <start> <start> it will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0484373356740586
<start> <start> <start> " yes , very indifferent indeed ," said elizabeth , laughingly . <end> <end> <end>
2.3908953316809303
<start> <start> <start> " oh , jane , take care ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3038230666503345

<start> <start> <start> " i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever ." <end> <end> <end>
2.297411605356931
<start> <start> <start> * * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and mrs . bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived . <end> <end> <end>
2.417956408925258
<start> <start> <start> on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time . <end> <end> <end>
2.5890128739736618
<start> <start> <start> when they repaired to the dining - room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . <end> <end> <end>
2.486992229457331
<start> <start> <start> her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.000031983018362
<start> <start> <start> on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided . <end> <end> <end>
2.140358530530089
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend . <end> <end> <end>
2.3258012198513036
<start> <start> <start> he bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr . darcy , with an expression of half - laughing alarm . <end> <end> <end>
2.5298592365418444
<start> <start> <start> his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . <end> <end> <end>
2.687628405662272
<start> <start> <start> though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . <end> <end> <end>
2.098924067812272
<start> <start> <start> it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . <end> <end> <end>
2.340705092794322
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them . <end> <end> <end>
2.6086500822446803
<start> <start> <start> he was on one side of her mother . <end> <end> <end>
2.765203004165819
<start> <start> <start> she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage . <end> <end> <end>
2.0199814552950075
<start> <start> <start> she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did . <end> <end> <end>
2.3179905943258694
<start> <start> <start> her mother ' s ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth ' s mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family . <end> <end> <end>
2.440247092559539
<start> <start> <start> she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . <end> <end> <end>
2.083415306448895
<start> <start> <start> anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing - room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil . <end> <end> <end>
1.9227853517399962
<start> <start> <start> she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . <end> <end> <end>
2.2365136386036464
<start> <start> <start> " if he does not come to me , _then_ ," said she , " i shall give him up for ever ." <end> <end> <end>
2.7329122796853373
<start> <start> <start> the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair . <end> <end> <end>
2.1972266021274978
<start> <start> <start> and on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " the men shan ' t come and part us , i am determined . <end> <end> <end>
2.4815867460232703
<start> <start> <start> darcy had walked away to another part of the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.489023686406165
<start> <start> <start> she followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly ! <end> <end> <end>
2.0656966386784257
<start> <start> <start> " a man who has once been refused ! <end> <end> <end>

2.0533870514147847
<start> <start> <start> she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success . <end> <end> <end>
2.437136394812292
<start> <start> <start> he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away . <end> <end> <end>
2.78661815160456
<start> <start> <start> when the tea - things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother ' s rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party . <end> <end> <end>
2.3230926795058497
<start> <start> <start> she now lost every expectation of pleasure . <end> <end> <end>
2.2613033227022576
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . <end> <end> <end>
2.2859759706253073
<start> <start> <start> " well girls ," said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " what say you to the day ? <end> <end> <end>

1.829193631714059

2.244281051714523
<start> <start> <start> it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3832659326677255

<start> <start> <start> a few days after this visit , mr . bingley called again , and alone . <end> <end> <end>
3.087027920264685
<start> <start> <start> his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days time . <end> <end> <end>
2.2860387178208432
<start> <start> <start> he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . <end> <end> <end>
2.6209000366493123
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . <end> <end> <end>
2.3569573393659353
<start> <start> <start> " next time you call ," said she , " i hope we shall be more lucky ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5740780330372175
<start> <start> <start> he should be particularly happy at any time , & c . & c .; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " can you come to - morrow ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.5944069083041437
<start> <start> <start> yes , he had no engagement at all for to - morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . <end> <end> <end>
2.6037263769136514
<start> <start> <start> he came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed . <end> <end> <end>
3.1282079835930356
<start> <start> <start> in ran mrs . bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " my dear jane , make haste and hurry down . <end> <end> <end>
2.594270029616652
<start> <start> <start> he is come -- mr . bingley is come .-- he is , indeed . <end> <end> <end>
2.664934381525747
<start> <start> <start> make haste , make haste . <end> <end> <end>
2.570903992230477

2.1686782915251124
<start> <start> <start> never mind miss lizzy ' s hair ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2528374019355044
<start> <start> <start> " we will be down as soon as we can ," said jane ; " but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago ." <end> <end> <end>
2.6982659981034014
<start> <start> <start> hang kitty ! <end> <end> <end>
2.6960910634566817
<start> <start> <start> what has she to do with it ? <end> <end> <end>
2.38159807976105
<start> <start> <start> come be quick , be quick ! <end> <end> <end>
2.3293531264384324
<start> <start> <start> but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . <end> <end> <end>
2.6117141976480607
<start> <start> <start> the same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening . <end> <end> <end>
2.1759860696237157
<start> <start> <start> after tea , mr . bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument . <end> <end> <end>
2.439388099587086
<start> <start> <start> two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs . bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them . <end> <end> <end>
2.0610140371128294
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , " what is the matter mamma ? <end> <end> <end>
2.658419374043982
<start> <start> <start> what do you keep winking at me for ? <end> <end> <end>
2.3517683163710803
<start> <start> <start> " nothing child , nothing . <end> <end> <end>
2.3379117351221907
<start> <start> <start> i did not wink at you ." <end> <end> <end>
2.402739377061804
<start> <start> <start> she then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , " come here , my love , i want to speak to you ," took her out of the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.1366114772188345
<start> <start> <start> in a few minutes , mrs . bennet half opened the door and called out , " lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you ." <end> <end> <end>
2.8948930069866567
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was forced to go . <end> <end> <end>
2.516018987678766
<start> <start> <start> " kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room ." <end> <end> <end>
2.124473713239935
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing - room . <end> <end> <end>
2.154400562097012
<start> <start> <start> he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs . bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . <end> <end> <end>
2.2492752275791763
<start> <start> <start> after this day , jane said no more of her indifference . <end> <end> <end>
2.5344757062553107
<start> <start> <start> not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr . darcy returned within the stated time . <end> <end> <end>
2.1628463504369333
<start> <start> <start> seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence . <end> <end> <end>
2.4748032384191037
<start> <start> <start> bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr . bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . <end> <end> <end>
2.579123375466971
<start> <start> <start> the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected . <end> <end> <end>
2.1802185263724625
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother ' s schemes . <end> <end> <end>
2.399594752587605
<start> <start> <start> but on returning to the drawing - room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her . <end> <end> <end>
2.441759910396315
<start> <start> <start> _their_ situation was awkward enough ; but _her ' s_ she thought was still worse . <end> <end> <end>
1.9951927022967024
<start> <start> <start> not a syllable was uttered by either ; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.2666920078628006
<start> <start> <start> jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . <end> <end> <end>
2.523656862344337
<start> <start> <start> she added , " by far too much . <end> <end> <end>
2.8000512888950717
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express . <end> <end> <end>
1.9109862385507104
<start> <start> <start> every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane . <end> <end> <end>
2.269876596821673
<start> <start> <start> but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present . <end> <end> <end>
2.8048536845335845
<start> <start> <start> " i must go instantly to my mother ;" she cried . <end> <end> <end>
2.0852491017738854
<start> <start> <start> he is gone to my father already . <end> <end> <end>
2.5822454659173855
<start> <start> <start> lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! <end> <end> <end>
2.4967878542476685
<start> <start> <start> how shall i bear so much happiness !" <end> <end> <end>
2.2318556783553065
<start> <start> <start> she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty . <end> <end> <end>
2.6222490587337304
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . <end> <end> <end>
2.0234688003490944
<start> <start> <start> " and this ," said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious circumspection ! <end> <end> <end>
2.6940144063135487
<start> <start> <start> of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! <end> <end> <end>
2.8578571281913137
<start> <start> <start> in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose . <end> <end> <end>
2.3047237661461444
<start> <start> <start> " where is your sister ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.444500266466675
<start> <start> <start> said he hastily , as he opened the door . <end> <end> <end>
2.643249889597267
<start> <start> <start> " with my mother up stairs . <end> <end> <end>
2.278277609525086
<start> <start> <start> she will be down in a moment i dare say ." <end> <end> <end>
3.027464268828966
<start> <start> <start> he then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . <end> <end> <end>
2.3461676449402513
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . <end> <end> <end>
2.1454957782144275
<start> <start> <start> they shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super - excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . <end> <end> <end>
2.4306243469342683
<start> <start> <start> it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of miss bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . <end> <end> <end>
2.392624254999086
<start> <start> <start> kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon . <end> <end> <end>
2.11986294571417
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when mr . bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was . <end> <end> <end>
2.208164012129934
<start> <start> <start> not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " jane , i congratulate you . <end> <end> <end>
2.6069566024499444
<start> <start> <start> you will be a very happy woman ." <end> <end> <end>
2.7795612401838072
<start> <start> <start> jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . <end> <end> <end>
2.2636084002446757
<start> <start> <start> " you are a good girl ;" he replied , " and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . <end> <end> <end>
2.7018452184795123
<start> <start> <start> i have not a doubt of your doing very well together . <end> <end> <end>
2.223501070647991
<start> <start> <start> your tempers are by no means unlike . <end> <end> <end>
2.5434674643276614
<start> <start> <start> you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0845866684834364
<start> <start> <start> " i hope not so . <end> <end> <end>
2.3660555152451996
<start> <start> <start> imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in _me_ ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1600251209712265
<start> <start> <start> " exceed their income ! <end> <end> <end>
2.381425453819338
<start> <start> <start> why , he has four or five thousand a - year , and very likely more ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3266991895266194
<start> <start> <start> then addressing her daughter , " oh ! <end> <end> <end>
2.622924588122888
<start> <start> <start> my dear , dear jane , i am so happy ! <end> <end> <end>
3.2179478305690075
<start> <start> <start> i am sure i sha ' nt get a wink of sleep all night . <end> <end> <end>
1.8791408877476756
<start> <start> <start> i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! <end> <end> <end>
2.6708074806892648
<start> <start> <start> wickham , lydia , were all forgotten . <end> <end> <end>
2.6408961460634197
<start> <start> <start> jane was beyond competition her favourite child . <end> <end> <end>
2.2018855239985977
<start> <start> <start> at that moment , she cared for no other . <end> <end> <end>
2.3677056441755973
<start> <start> <start> mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . <end> <end> <end>
2.0162278942602283
<start> <start> <start> bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . <end> <end> <end>
2.2495692286626467
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . <end> <end> <end>
2.3001511123823173
<start> <start> <start> in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief . <end> <end> <end>
2.615751039156608
<start> <start> <start> " he has made me so happy ," said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! <end> <end> <end>

2.2564902077705478

<start> <start> <start> i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.398814263351941
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible . <end> <end> <end>

2.2893520976531194
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr . darcy . <end> <end> <end>
2.180993818498279
<start> <start> <start> it was a rational scheme to be sure ! <end> <end> <end>
2.4940114065096775
<start> <start> <start> but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley , and _her_ being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea . <end> <end> <end>
2.0710575787371255
<start> <start> <start> she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . <end> <end> <end>
2.3530453021375517
<start> <start> <start> and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set _that_ down , as almost certain and immediate , which _she_ had looked forward to as possible , at some future time . <end> <end> <end>
1.9069244115738724
<start> <start> <start> in revolving lady catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference . <end> <end> <end>
2.5399228414843256
<start> <start> <start> from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce . <end> <end> <end>
2.251527360609231
<start> <start> <start> she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side . <end> <end> <end>
2.0980686775357946
<start> <start> <start> with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning . <end> <end> <end>
1.8799931384527522
<start> <start> <start> if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him . <end> <end> <end>
2.1893031664896756
<start> <start> <start> in that case he would return no more . <end> <end> <end>
2.2727090543398907
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way . <end> <end> <end>
2.2887732957250977
<start> <start> <start> " if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days ," she added , " i shall know how to understand it . <end> <end> <end>

2.105746061578855
<start> <start> <start> the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " lizzy ," said he , " i was going to look for you ; come into my room ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4405212452190765
<start> <start> <start> she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . <end> <end> <end>
2.364134559517851
<start> <start> <start> she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down . <end> <end> <end>
2.7121335242695888
<start> <start> <start> he then said , " i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . <end> <end> <end>
2.465639634629803
<start> <start> <start> as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . <end> <end> <end>

2.3261733059408085
<start> <start> <start> the colour now rushed into elizabeth ' s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " you look conscious . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances . <end> <end> <end>
2.01784321727698
<start> <start> <start> the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart - felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . <end> <end> <end>

2.045985462556265
<start> <start> <start> another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . <end> <end> <end>
2.469248338483041
<start> <start> <start> when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish . <end> <end> <end>
2.3747524660769987
<start> <start> <start> " now i am quite happy ," said she , " for you will be as happy as myself . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> i always had a value for him . <end> <end> <end>
2.334186941317011
<start> <start> <start> were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me . <end> <end> <end>
2.361474180096105
<start> <start> <start> but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . <end> <end> <end>
2.7499507088458692
<start> <start> <start> how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton ! <end> <end> <end>
2.197433327700405
<start> <start> <start> i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you ." <end> <end> <end>
2.9590059895307284
<start> <start> <start> she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend . <end> <end> <end>
2.5313791483492345
<start> <start> <start> all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation . <end> <end> <end>
2.1925820133980674
<start> <start> <start> * * * * * " good gracious !" <end> <end> <end>
2.142100233497551
<start> <start> <start> cried mrs . bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable mr . darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley ! <end> <end> <end>
2.6514545850955518
<start> <start> <start> what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? <end> <end> <end>
2.363289492160275
<start> <start> <start> i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company . <end> <end> <end>
2.3037391208743503
<start> <start> <start> what shall we do with him ? <end> <end> <end>
2.4203773615493813
<start> <start> <start> lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley ' s way ." <end> <end> <end>
3.318246536503822
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet . <end> <end> <end>
1.9257985205340848
<start> <start> <start> as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " mr . bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to - day ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.3206532061892786
<start> <start> <start> " i advise mr . darcy , and lizzy , and kitty ," said mrs . bennet , " to walk to oakham mount this morning . <end> <end> <end>
2.6353762701477272
<start> <start> <start> " it may do very well for the others ," replied mr . bingley ; " but i am sure it will be too much for kitty . <end> <end> <end>
3.0484478607885332
<start> <start> <start> wont it , kitty ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.5186433034574223
<start> <start> <start> kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . <end> <end> <end>
2.670825980597308
<start> <start> <start> as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs . bennet followed her , saying , " i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . <end> <end> <end>
2.632677903772417
<start> <start> <start> so , do not put yourself to inconvenience ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4837409753287774
<start> <start> <start> during their walk , it was resolved that mr . bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening . <end> <end> <end>
2.7616207568803537
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ' s . <end> <end> <end>
2.5274696778886225
<start> <start> <start> she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man . <end> <end> <end>
1.909854168478265
<start> <start> <start> but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr . darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation . <end> <end> <end>
2.2626181132223695
<start> <start> <start> * * * * * in the evening , soon after mr . bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr . darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . <end> <end> <end>
2.800868077177433
<start> <start> <start> in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " go to your father , he wants you in the library ." <end> <end> <end>
2.258475652338498
<start> <start> <start> she was gone directly . <end> <end> <end>
2.5700003228622337
<start> <start> <start> her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . <end> <end> <end>
2.551993974267519
<start> <start> <start> " lizzy ," said he , " what are you doing ? <end> <end> <end>
2.6809413511926747
<start> <start> <start> have not you always hated him ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.3126253366091736
<start> <start> <start> how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! <end> <end> <end>
1.9127318647367964
<start> <start> <start> it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr . darcy . <end> <end> <end>
2.1992406010067036
<start> <start> <start> " or in other words , you are determined to have him . <end> <end> <end>

2.4532450725278165
<start> <start> <start> but will they make you happy ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.208135692357219
<start> <start> <start> " have you any other objection ," said elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ?" <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him ." <end> <end> <end>
2.303581247095586
<start> <start> <start> " i do , i do like him ," she replied , with tears in her eyes , " i love him . <end> <end> <end>
2.646126036717489
<start> <start> <start> indeed he has no improper pride . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> he is perfectly amiable . <end> <end> <end>
2.713950329990454
<start> <start> <start> you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4014020660575617
<start> <start> <start> he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask . <end> <end> <end>
2.7325006295242322
<start> <start> <start> i now give it to _you_ , if you are resolved on having him . <end> <end> <end>

2.3664509626127055
<start> <start> <start> i know your disposition , lizzy . <end> <end> <end>
2.3933011034708955
<start> <start> <start> i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior . <end> <end> <end>
1.9792046226833941
<start> <start> <start> your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . <end> <end> <end>
2.0222280915578867
<start> <start> <start> you could scarcely escape discredit and misery . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> my child , let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life . <end> <end> <end>
1.9978293966260268
<start> <start> <start> you know not what you are about ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5241450284416174
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr . darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match . <end> <end> <end>
2.0179250107224656
<start> <start> <start> " well , my dear ," said he , when she ceased speaking , " i have no more to say . <end> <end> <end>
3.1475292065522775
<start> <start> <start> i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy ." <end> <end> <end>
2.898482220347628
<start> <start> <start> to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr . darcy had voluntarily done for lydia . <end> <end> <end>
2.277181012885014
<start> <start> <start> he heard her with astonishment . <end> <end> <end>
2.283692237718184
<start> <start> <start> " this is an evening of wonders , indeed ! <end> <end> <end>
2.2107177764746115
<start> <start> <start> so much the better . <end> <end> <end>
2.259459073964843

2.069671639334353
<start> <start> <start> i shall offer to pay him to - morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4538535360134355
<start> <start> <start> he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr . collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go -- saying , as she quitted the room , " if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3981607490238037
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . <end> <end> <end>
2.3798356395285585
<start> <start> <start> every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time . <end> <end> <end>
2.352367428239852
<start> <start> <start> when her mother went up to her dressing - room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . <end> <end> <end>
2.6350936778127005
<start> <start> <start> nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . <end> <end> <end>
2.259830293929888
<start> <start> <start> she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> i shall go distracted ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4960888958627168
<start> <start> <start> this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . <end> <end> <end>
2.1435714138891235
<start> <start> <start> but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her . <end> <end> <end>
2.4814980719039523
<start> <start> <start> " my dearest child ," she cried , " i can think of nothing else ! <end> <end> <end>

2.5660105731482563
<start> <start> <start> but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs . bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . <end> <end> <end>
2.28883707120808
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and mr . bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley . <end> <end> <end>

2.344499553546315
<start> <start> <start> i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well - informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly . <end> <end> <end>

2.2264923568590986

2.0040833649374816
<start> <start> <start> the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia , and , removed from the influence of lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid . <end> <end> <end>
2.048209370639616
<start> <start> <start> mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs . bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone . <end> <end> <end>
2.4550184453585446
<start> <start> <start> mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . <end> <end> <end>
2.1461230289838187
<start> <start> <start> the letter was to this effect : " my dear lizzy , " i wish you joy . <end> <end> <end>

1.9013831656341174
<start> <start> <start> it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills . <end> <end> <end>

2.1029091877870574
<start> <start> <start> though darcy could never receive _him_ at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession . <end> <end> <end>
2.3512568389789856
<start> <start> <start> lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone . <end> <end> <end>
2.070830758297997
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy ' s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth . <end> <end> <end>
1.953301126021761
<start> <start> <start> pemberley was now georgiana ' s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see . <end> <end> <end>

2.548828116070552
<start> <start> <start> georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother . <end> <end> <end>
2.0324740267411165
<start> <start> <start> he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . <end> <end> <end>
2.0606559166254166
<start> <start> <start> her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way . <end> <end> <end>
2.121441617724802
<start> <start> <start> by elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . <end> <end> <end>
2.1688385113530404
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . <end> <end> <end>
2.1778737520896443
<start> <start> <start> but at length , by elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city . <end> <end> <end>
