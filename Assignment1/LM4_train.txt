2.1702655097230164
<start> <start> <start> you and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , mr . bingley might like you the best of the party ." <end> <end> <end>

1.9946798467542513
<start> <start> <start> i dare say mr . bingley will be very glad to see you ; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " they have none of them much to recommend them ," replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters ." <end> <end> <end>

2.309747740451407
<start> <start> <start> mr . bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . <end> <end> <end>
1.7129823004386604
<start> <start> <start> _her_ mind was less difficult to develope . <end> <end> <end>
1.9960849746083433
<start> <start> <start> she was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper . <end> <end> <end>
1.7703226965440604
<start> <start> <start> when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous . <end> <end> <end>
1.935282942036278
<start> <start> <start> the business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> mr . bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr . bingley . <end> <end> <end>
2.4708741215779773
<start> <start> <start> he had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it . <end> <end> <end>
1.9109846824144738
<start> <start> <start> it was then disclosed in the following manner . <end> <end> <end>
2.049214157751257
<start> <start> <start> observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " i hope mr . bingley will like it lizzy ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1071227357681304
<start> <start> <start> " we are not in a way to know _what_ mr . bingley likes ," said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0723036604460914
<start> <start> <start> " but you forget , mama ," said elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that mrs . long has promised to introduce him ." <end> <end> <end>
2.142328008992746
<start> <start> <start> " i do not believe mrs . long will do any such thing . <end> <end> <end>
1.966567566761017
<start> <start> <start> she has two nieces of her own . <end> <end> <end>
2.301773015629147
<start> <start> <start> " no more have i ," said mr . bennet ; " and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you ." <end> <end> <end>
2.268575667370885
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters . <end> <end> <end>
1.8946494458576824
<start> <start> <start> " don ' t keep coughing so , kitty , for heaven ' s sake ! <end> <end> <end>
1.9951217710200506
<start> <start> <start> have a little compassion on my nerves . <end> <end> <end>
2.2583476778833087
<start> <start> <start> you tear them to pieces ." <end> <end> <end>
2.131300314318542
<start> <start> <start> " kitty has no discretion in her coughs ," said her father ; " she times them ill ." " i do not cough for my own amusement ," replied kitty fretfully . <end> <end> <end>
1.6865894118758897
<start> <start> <start> " when is your next ball to be , lizzy ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.8978333656178843
<start> <start> <start> " to - morrow fortnight ." <end> <end> <end>
2.6072283470813065
<start> <start> <start> " aye , so it is ," cried her mother , " and mrs . long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself ." <end> <end> <end>
2.263651724035677
<start> <start> <start> " then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce mr . bingley to _her_ ." <end> <end> <end>
2.500135553278833
<start> <start> <start> " impossible , mr . bennet , impossible , when i am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.3902564381392337
<start> <start> <start> a fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little . <end> <end> <end>
2.0253591369315065
<start> <start> <start> one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . <end> <end> <end>
1.8995167776175426
<start> <start> <start> but if _we_ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , mrs . long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , i will take it on myself ." <end> <end> <end>
1.79913243762546
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet said only , " nonsense , nonsense !" <end> <end> <end>
1.9036685180217645
<start> <start> <start> " what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.8336069488670623
<start> <start> <start> cried he . <end> <end> <end>
2.615537057526069
<start> <start> <start> " do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? <end> <end> <end>
1.803121945409079
<start> <start> <start> i cannot quite agree with you _there_ . <end> <end> <end>
1.9465243601282367
<start> <start> <start> what say you , mary ? <end> <end> <end>
2.1911159784343877
<start> <start> <start> for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know , and read great books , and make extracts ." <end> <end> <end>
2.128284577184842
<start> <start> <start> mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . <end> <end> <end>
2.0587992446504497
<start> <start> <start> " while mary is adjusting her ideas ," he continued , " let us return to mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.0488813817872638
<start> <start> <start> bingley ." <end> <end> <end>
2.9407826700058703
<start> <start> <start> " i am sick of mr . bingley ," cried his wife . <end> <end> <end>
2.5535060615196903
<start> <start> <start> " i am sorry to hear _that_ ; but why did not you tell me so before ? <end> <end> <end>
1.8212037515669304
<start> <start> <start> if i had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on him . <end> <end> <end>
2.121337630869521
<start> <start> <start> it is very unlucky ; but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0180994554760816
<start> <start> <start> the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of mrs . bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . <end> <end> <end>
1.933263070841136
<start> <start> <start> " how good it was in you , my dear mr . bennet ! <end> <end> <end>
2.692177690404529
<start> <start> <start> well , how pleased i am ! <end> <end> <end>
2.056526270813458
<start> <start> <start> and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now ." <end> <end> <end>
2.312086321153772
<start> <start> <start> " now , kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse ," said mr . bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . <end> <end> <end>
2.4345806853072114
<start> <start> <start> " what an excellent father you have , girls ," said she , when the door was shut . <end> <end> <end>
2.0232900493841184
<start> <start> <start> " i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . <end> <end> <end>
1.5782062351451511
<start> <start> <start> at our time of life , it is not so pleasant i can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing . <end> <end> <end>
2.038417258660818
<start> <start> <start> lydia , my love , though you _are_ the youngest , i dare say mr . bingley will dance with you at the next ball ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9726789135395786
<start> <start> <start> the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr . bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner . <end> <end> <end>
1.9659846791086375
<start> <start> <start> not all that mrs . bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr . bingley . <end> <end> <end>
2.412106926156688
<start> <start> <start> they attacked him in various ways ; with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second - hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas . <end> <end> <end>
1.662928353648397
<start> <start> <start> her report was highly favourable . <end> <end> <end>
2.1219220452766834
<start> <start> <start> sir william had been delighted with him . <end> <end> <end>
1.9605731225932481
<start> <start> <start> he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . <end> <end> <end>
1.9940851498206893
<start> <start> <start> nothing could be more delightful ! <end> <end> <end>
2.4997196370917405
<start> <start> <start> to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of mr . bingley ' s heart were entertained . <end> <end> <end>
1.8956432999006398
<start> <start> <start> " if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield ," said mrs . bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2272402893137473
<start> <start> <start> in a few days mr . bingley returned mr . bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library . <end> <end> <end>
2.3827653759264114
<start> <start> <start> he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . <end> <end> <end>
1.909339474561325
<start> <start> <start> an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had mrs . bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . <end> <end> <end>
1.6640110617186692
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , & c . mrs . bennet was quite disconcerted . <end> <end> <end>
2.313263751773289
<start> <start> <start> the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin . <end> <end> <end>
1.570445783087275
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley was good looking and gentleman - like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . <end> <end> <end>
1.9844376806930009
<start> <start> <start> his sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion . <end> <end> <end>
1.9717676205411028
<start> <start> <start> his brother - in - law , mr . hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend mr . darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . <end> <end> <end>
1.9076507770642819
<start> <start> <start> the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr . bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . <end> <end> <end>
1.6539547418416507
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield . <end> <end> <end>
1.6725105276285686
<start> <start> <start> such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . <end> <end> <end>
2.062327556612405
<start> <start> <start> what a contrast between him and his friend ! <end> <end> <end>
2.1415694859498786
<start> <start> <start> his character was decided . <end> <end> <end>
2.2551960035977574
<start> <start> <start> he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again . <end> <end> <end>
2.0710420125943108
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , mr . darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr . bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it . <end> <end> <end>
1.8894277468338836
<start> <start> <start> you had much better dance ." <end> <end> <end>

2.3190666477591533
<start> <start> <start> and turning round , he looked for a moment at elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " she is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_ ; and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . <end> <end> <end>
1.7608298704319736
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley followed his advice . <end> <end> <end>
2.3348831372615697
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy walked off ; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him . <end> <end> <end>
1.934915989203724
<start> <start> <start> she told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous . <end> <end> <end>
1.6859261960836243
<start> <start> <start> the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . <end> <end> <end>
1.8667798056187668
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party . <end> <end> <end>
1.9054886918549538
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters . <end> <end> <end>
2.3693885483014867
<start> <start> <start> mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . <end> <end> <end>

1.827307884561408
<start> <start> <start> he had rather hoped that all his wife ' s views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear . <end> <end> <end>

1.9234380061807297
<start> <start> <start> only think of _that_ my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . <end> <end> <end>
2.016266552240638
<start> <start> <start> first of all , he asked miss lucas . <end> <end> <end>
2.0662878584297415
<start> <start> <start> i was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance . <end> <end> <end>
2.13824850221508
<start> <start> <start> so , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him ! <end> <end> <end>
2.072024249535795

2.165263143401224
<start> <start> <start> when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr . bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . <end> <end> <end>
2.0303378688408373
<start> <start> <start> " he is just what a young man ought to be ," said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and i never saw such happy manners !-- so much ease , with such perfect good breeding !" <end> <end> <end>

2.50417478999844

1.9077777084197123
<start> <start> <start> no thanks to his gallantry for that . <end> <end> <end>
1.9848867996839072
<start> <start> <start> well , he certainly is very agreeable , and i give you leave to like him . <end> <end> <end>

2.433818658730225

2.231843222665605
<start> <start> <start> you never see a fault in any body . <end> <end> <end>

1.8804555684740496
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . <end> <end> <end>
1.8074990680926168
<start> <start> <start> they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . <end> <end> <end>
1.6846600150291882
<start> <start> <start> they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others . <end> <end> <end>
1.7970105129710823
<start> <start> <start> bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase . <end> <end> <end>
1.6539981646990305
<start> <start> <start> his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs . hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . <end> <end> <end>
1.7373961432157712
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house . <end> <end> <end>
1.917885701503802
<start> <start> <start> on the strength of darcy ' s regard bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . <end> <end> <end>
2.1919021134972665
<start> <start> <start> in understanding darcy was the superior . <end> <end> <end>
2.0775756594724335
<start> <start> <start> bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever . <end> <end> <end>
2.0148667514470784
<start> <start> <start> he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . <end> <end> <end>
1.8023387930699335
<start> <start> <start> in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . <end> <end> <end>
2.005903658887289
<start> <start> <start> bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence . <end> <end> <end>
1.6670245964916621
<start> <start> <start> the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . <end> <end> <end>
1.956621702701584
<start> <start> <start> bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . <end> <end> <end>
1.8991442259798537
<start> <start> <start> darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . <end> <end> <end>
1.6887377060388467
<start> <start> <start> miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much . <end> <end> <end>
1.9773881812118854
<start> <start> <start> mrs . hurst and her sister allowed it to be so -- but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter v . within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate . <end> <end> <end>
1.6418362684063112
<start> <start> <start> the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . <end> <end> <end>
1.839478958342122
<start> <start> <start> it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . <end> <end> <end>
1.6535484362178476
<start> <start> <start> for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body . <end> <end> <end>
1.8356530682579726
<start> <start> <start> by nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at st . james ' s had made him courteous . <end> <end> <end>
1.640586555420231
<start> <start> <start> lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs . <end> <end> <end>
2.2515748729782334
<start> <start> <start> the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty - seven , was elizabeth ' s intimate friend . <end> <end> <end>
1.9428882930962632
<start> <start> <start> that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate . <end> <end> <end>
1.7558306379260633
<start> <start> <start> " _you_ began the evening well , charlotte ," said mrs . bennet with civil self - command to miss lucas . <end> <end> <end>

1.8576729718092577
<start> <start> <start> " miss bingley told me ," said jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . <end> <end> <end>

2.6037715999340376
<start> <start> <start> but i can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs . long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9447412860569286

1.8004461901739404
<start> <start> <start> by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . <end> <end> <end>
1.725711202843278
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . <end> <end> <end>
1.7080886192360387
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> he paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , " my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing ?-- mr . <end> <end> <end>

1.9304120317304505
<start> <start> <start> her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley , " i can guess the subject of your reverie ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " but , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , i am sure . <end> <end> <end>

1.7210965888256313
<start> <start> <start> " but if you have got them to - day ," said elizabeth , " my mother ' s purpose will be answered ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3389556912327243
<start> <start> <start> she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged . <end> <end> <end>
1.7240084922088204
<start> <start> <start> her hopes were answered ; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard . <end> <end> <end>
1.9250666269000796
<start> <start> <start> her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted . <end> <end> <end>
2.512702348889223
<start> <start> <start> the rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; jane certainly could not come back . <end> <end> <end>
1.754996882041147
<start> <start> <start> " this was a lucky idea of mine , indeed !" <end> <end> <end>
1.9109306188982187
<start> <start> <start> said mrs . bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . <end> <end> <end>
2.2838777038447233
<start> <start> <start> till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . <end> <end> <end>
2.8385354369692033
<start> <start> <start> breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth : " my dearest lizzy , " i find myself very unwell this morning , which , i suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . <end> <end> <end>
1.8385408276175725
<start> <start> <start> they insist also on my seeing mr . jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and excepting a sore - throat and head - ache there is not much the matter with me . <end> <end> <end>
1.581822991096344
<start> <start> <start> " yours , & c ." " well , my dear ," said mr . bennet , when elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr . bingley , and under your orders ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1766028788963614
<start> <start> <start> i am not at all afraid of her dying . <end> <end> <end>
2.2412731726871358
<start> <start> <start> people do not die of little trifling colds . <end> <end> <end>
1.8849518633411395
<start> <start> <start> as long as she stays there , it is all very well . <end> <end> <end>
2.421464687536114
<start> <start> <start> i would go and see her , if i could have the carriage ." <end> <end> <end>
2.6218536688058696
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse - woman , walking was her only alternative . <end> <end> <end>
2.039792341464628
<start> <start> <start> she declared her resolution . <end> <end> <end>
2.3057004919459554
<start> <start> <start> " how can you be so silly ," cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! <end> <end> <end>
2.276616952432464
<start> <start> <start> you will not be fit to be seen when you get there ." <end> <end> <end>
2.278704797637013
<start> <start> <start> " i shall be very fit to see jane -- which is all i want ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9094203634944213
<start> <start> <start> " is this a hint to me , lizzy ," said her father , " to send for the horses ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.1522975050077573
<start> <start> <start> " no , indeed . <end> <end> <end>
2.22875205322145
<start> <start> <start> the distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . <end> <end> <end>
1.668827446878451
<start> <start> <start> i shall be back by dinner ." <end> <end> <end>
2.209920479000356
<start> <start> <start> " i admire the activity of your benevolence ," observed mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required ." <end> <end> <end>
1.711882502355867
<start> <start> <start> " we will go as far as meryton with you ," said catherine and lydia .-- elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together . <end> <end> <end>
1.9823548052620443
<start> <start> <start> in meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise . <end> <end> <end>
1.5238246903775148
<start> <start> <start> she was shewn into the breakfast - parlour , where all but jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise .-- that she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs . hurst and miss bingley ; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . <end> <end> <end>
1.8429005354331214
<start> <start> <start> she was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness .-- mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.106383008602062
<start> <start> <start> darcy said very little , and mr . hurst nothing at all . <end> <end> <end>
2.5060468189708454
<start> <start> <start> the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s justifying her coming so far alone . <end> <end> <end>
1.6065991360019
<start> <start> <start> her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . <end> <end> <end>
1.9509482491429235
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . <end> <end> <end>
1.6515128291748442
<start> <start> <start> she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . <end> <end> <end>
1.811177124134149
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth silently attended her . <end> <end> <end>
2.2879043293940082
<start> <start> <start> the apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . <end> <end> <end>
2.0865494469528127
<start> <start> <start> the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely . <end> <end> <end>
1.9879840644939704
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere . <end> <end> <end>
1.7413087254911088
<start> <start> <start> when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so . <end> <end> <end>
1.8550413053936023
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern in parting with her , that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present . <end> <end> <end>
1.9921322277496438
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter viii . <end> <end> <end>
2.2704477686791944
<start> <start> <start> to the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr . bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer . <end> <end> <end>
2.2583061429308855
<start> <start> <start> jane was by no means better . <end> <end> <end>
2.485261804322359
<start> <start> <start> the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . <end> <end> <end>
1.684928958641925
<start> <start> <start> their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency . <end> <end> <end>
2.469650998838639
<start> <start> <start> his anxiety for jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others . <end> <end> <end>
1.7056006157746708
<start> <start> <start> she had very little notice from any but him . <end> <end> <end>
1.881186283101218
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley was engrossed by mr . darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for mr . hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her . <end> <end> <end>
1.8735228561749697
<start> <start> <start> when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.319017509878432
<start> <start> <start> her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty . <end> <end> <end>
1.7812711483517916
<start> <start> <start> mrs . hurst thought the same , and added , " she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . <end> <end> <end>
2.070534184256687
<start> <start> <start> i shall never forget her appearance this morning . <end> <end> <end>
2.0377007873155724
<start> <start> <start> " she did indeed , louisa . <end> <end> <end>
2.1434582655662653
<start> <start> <start> i could hardly keep my countenance . <end> <end> <end>
2.0431424429304843
<start> <start> <start> very nonsensical to come at all ! <end> <end> <end>
2.153641081778217
<start> <start> <start> why must _she_ be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? <end> <end> <end>
1.7645745404137394
<start> <start> <start> her hair so untidy , so blowsy !" <end> <end> <end>
1.928779439521979
<start> <start> <start> " your picture may be very exact , louisa ," said bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me . <end> <end> <end>
1.7880258563377003
<start> <start> <start> i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning . <end> <end> <end>
2.1520298666909072
<start> <start> <start> her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8903751560673556
<start> <start> <start> " _you_ observed it , mr . darcy , i am sure ," said miss bingley ; " and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2543721993017
<start> <start> <start> " certainly not ." <end> <end> <end>
2.383786175882984
<start> <start> <start> " to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! <end> <end> <end>
1.6860239180766354
<start> <start> <start> it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum ." <end> <end> <end>
1.6905027543688835
<start> <start> <start> " i am afraid , mr . darcy ," observed miss bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3056466763219166
<start> <start> <start> -- a short pause followed this speech , and mrs . hurst began again . <end> <end> <end>
2.3178046341006517
<start> <start> <start> " i have an excessive regard for jane bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled . <end> <end> <end>
1.922210634393499
<start> <start> <start> but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4300518081758997
<start> <start> <start> " i think i have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in meryton ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9077667998841137
<start> <start> <start> " that is capital ," added her sister , and they both laughed heartily . <end> <end> <end>
2.1909895102643104
<start> <start> <start> " but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world ," replied darcy . <end> <end> <end>
1.9615948366886862
<start> <start> <start> to this speech bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend ' s vulgar relations . <end> <end> <end>
1.6487355379283535
<start> <start> <start> with a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining - parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . <end> <end> <end>
1.9380896902742697
<start> <start> <start> she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.0909037766044314
<start> <start> <start> on entering the drawing - room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book . <end> <end> <end>
1.6947742781409847
<start> <start> <start> mr . hurst looked at her with astonishment . <end> <end> <end>
2.3811254613830344
<start> <start> <start> " do you prefer reading to cards ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.934861308126028
<start> <start> <start> said he ; " that is rather singular ." <end> <end> <end>
2.479610233102799
<start> <start> <start> she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else ." <end> <end> <end>
1.896727993119148
<start> <start> <start> " in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure ," said bingley ; " and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well ." <end> <end> <end>
2.018684228812178
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying . <end> <end> <end>
1.8599366639815464
<start> <start> <start> he immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded . <end> <end> <end>
1.7565288364583638
<start> <start> <start> " and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but i am an idle fellow , and though i have not many , i have more than i ever look into ." <end> <end> <end>
2.034335822554289
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.0329166683672266
<start> <start> <start> " i am astonished ," said miss bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books .-- what a delightful library you have at pemberley , mr . <end> <end> <end>
1.9605502452069765
<start> <start> <start> " and then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9153424342046095
<start> <start> <start> " i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these ." <end> <end> <end>

2.322781396756109
<start> <start> <start> " but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model . <end> <end> <end>
1.7810967653916292
<start> <start> <start> there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire ." <end> <end> <end>

1.8796370274149432
<start> <start> <start> " upon my word , caroline , i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7132634439681136
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card - table , and stationed herself between mr . bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game . <end> <end> <end>
1.8390639596742155
<start> <start> <start> " is miss darcy much grown since the spring ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.939248409288219

<start> <start> <start> " i think she will . <end> <end> <end>
2.2267990687951165

1.9391865980042604
<start> <start> <start> " it is amazing to me ," said bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are ." <end> <end> <end>

1.7260585194451046
<start> <start> <start> i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " your list of the common extent of accomplishments ," said darcy , " has too much truth . <end> <end> <end>

1.5919486188923493
<start> <start> <start> " all this she must possess ," added darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> mrs . hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr . hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward . <end> <end> <end>
1.5265481325602888

<start> <start> <start> " eliza bennet ," said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds . <end> <end> <end>
2.1209818024623326
<start> <start> <start> but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1656306735171116
<start> <start> <start> " undoubtedly ," replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her . <end> <end> <end>
2.481006877733987
<start> <start> <start> bingley urged mr . jones ' s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians . <end> <end> <end>
1.6727122704498791
<start> <start> <start> this , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled that mr . jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better . <end> <end> <end>
2.384059687355605
<start> <start> <start> bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable . <end> <end> <end>
1.9265472192894384
<start> <start> <start> they solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> had she found jane in any apparent danger , mrs . bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield . <end> <end> <end>
1.77307798842282
<start> <start> <start> she would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . <end> <end> <end>

2.106177461059766
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph . <end> <end> <end>

2.1564955239898906
<start> <start> <start> when she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> but however he did not . <end> <end> <end>
2.6869008393009968
<start> <start> <start> perhaps he thought her too young . <end> <end> <end>
2.066755918960884
<start> <start> <start> however , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4298387570463413

1.7131415784886919
<start> <start> <start> darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again . <end> <end> <end>
1.696236996549505
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . <end> <end> <end>
1.7287087059981678
<start> <start> <start> she performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but mrs . bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . <end> <end> <end>
1.8294585189909793
<start> <start> <start> upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward . <end> <end> <end>
1.7848350183682726
<start> <start> <start> the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax mr . bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield . <end> <end> <end>
2.1108037659237953
<start> <start> <start> lydia was a stout , well - grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good - humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . <end> <end> <end>
1.6735478813266322
<start> <start> <start> she had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self - consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ' s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . <end> <end> <end>
1.9751749685161897
<start> <start> <start> she was very equal therefore to address mr . bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . <end> <end> <end>
2.1549376140711467
<start> <start> <start> " i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball . <end> <end> <end>
1.8800979936916904
<start> <start> <start> but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill ." lydia declared herself satisfied . <end> <end> <end>
1.7696233188732646
<start> <start> <start> yes -- it would be much better to wait till jane was well , and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again . <end> <end> <end>
1.8785116835651614
<start> <start> <start> and when you have given _your_ ball ," she added , " i shall insist on their giving one also . <end> <end> <end>
2.007096316249532
<start> <start> <start> i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not ." <end> <end> <end>
2.165994641790819
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet and her daughters then departed , and elizabeth returned instantly to jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr . darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_ , in spite of all miss bingley ' s witticisms on _fine eyes_ . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand - writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each . <end> <end> <end>

1.6614539865649385
<start> <start> <start> " your humility , mr . bingley ," said elizabeth , " must disarm reproof ." <end> <end> <end>
2.491646684355105

1.7955513192226
<start> <start> <start> allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety ." <end> <end> <end>
1.928433597175885

2.276633209100268

1.5957832929659441
<start> <start> <start> " by all means ," cried bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do ." <end> <end> <end>
1.846453738705345
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy smiled ; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh . <end> <end> <end>
2.22143293934766
<start> <start> <start> " perhaps i do . <end> <end> <end>

1.9599066166855885
<start> <start> <start> " what you ask ," said elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and mr . darcy had much better finish his letter ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3355127124081996
<start> <start> <start> when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music . <end> <end> <end>
1.992042341227053
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano - forte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself . <end> <end> <end>
1.5602593374891092
<start> <start> <start> mrs . hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently mr . darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her . <end> <end> <end>
1.868376469940183
<start> <start> <start> she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange . <end> <end> <end>
2.0333434023320973
<start> <start> <start> she could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present . <end> <end> <end>
1.7907589554151588
<start> <start> <start> the supposition did not pain her . <end> <end> <end>
2.0441988947683907
<start> <start> <start> she liked him too little to care for his approbation . <end> <end> <end>
1.9650745603251354
<start> <start> <start> after playing some italian songs , miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air ; and soon afterwards mr . darcy , drawing near elizabeth , said to her -- " do not you feel a great inclination , miss bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.8388193386237988
<start> <start> <start> she smiled , but made no answer . <end> <end> <end>
2.081772981771756
<start> <start> <start> said she , " i heard you before ; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply . <end> <end> <end>
2.4703811971219682
<start> <start> <start> you wanted me , i know , to say ' yes ,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt . <end> <end> <end>
1.7804044076826135
<start> <start> <start> i have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that i do not want to dance a reel at all -- and now despise me if you dare ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8058325054194113
<start> <start> <start> " indeed i do not dare ." <end> <end> <end>
2.6809067329107417
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her . <end> <end> <end>
1.6944746901298455
<start> <start> <start> he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger . <end> <end> <end>
1.8374248086518938
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth . <end> <end> <end>
1.5873683433778454
<start> <start> <start> she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . <end> <end> <end>
1.5512683549077566
<start> <start> <start> " have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.8474788061742442
<start> <start> <start> yes .-- do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley . <end> <end> <end>
1.816810899444282
<start> <start> <start> put them next to your great uncle the judge . <end> <end> <end>
1.8467843250273186
<start> <start> <start> they are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines . <end> <end> <end>
2.148078526635211
<start> <start> <start> as for your elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.9759020225844188
<start> <start> <start> " it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye - lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8659393985494546
<start> <start> <start> at that moment they were met from another walk , by mrs . hurst and elizabeth herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.0813215535233844
<start> <start> <start> " i did not know that you intended to walk ," said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard . <end> <end> <end>
2.048349246236008
<start> <start> <start> " you used us abominably ill ," answered mrs . hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8765728760057627
<start> <start> <start> then taking the disengaged arm of mr . darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.000075860880409
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said ,-- " this walk is not wide enough for our party . <end> <end> <end>
1.6062225250872533
<start> <start> <start> we had better go into the avenue ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1136564640181787
<start> <start> <start> but elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " no , no ; stay where you are .-- you are charmingly group ' d , and appear to uncommon advantage . <end> <end> <end>
1.8694215701412356
<start> <start> <start> the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth . <end> <end> <end>
1.7700481839688178
<start> <start> <start> good bye ." <end> <end> <end>
2.575207271892539
<start> <start> <start> she then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two . <end> <end> <end>
1.81020473134151
<start> <start> <start> jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening . <end> <end> <end>
1.654256507444517
<start> <start> <start> when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing - room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . <end> <end> <end>
1.8335545789193968
<start> <start> <start> their powers of conversation were considerable . <end> <end> <end>
2.0222845925528823
<start> <start> <start> but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object . <end> <end> <end>
2.226669653924182
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . <end> <end> <end>
2.215670626582615
<start> <start> <start> he addressed himself directly to miss bennet , with a polite congratulation ; mr . hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley ' s salutation . <end> <end> <end>
2.031750419261967
<start> <start> <start> he was full of joy and attention . <end> <end> <end>
1.9417358872109953
<start> <start> <start> the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire - place , that she might be farther from the door . <end> <end> <end>
1.8294153874659436
<start> <start> <start> he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else . <end> <end> <end>
2.360449662839416
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight . <end> <end> <end>
1.703550506091944
<start> <start> <start> when tea was over , mr . hurst reminded his sister - in - law of the card - table -- but in vain . <end> <end> <end>
2.043387907858685
<start> <start> <start> she had obtained private intelligence that mr . darcy did not wish for cards ; and mr . hurst soon found even his open petition rejected . <end> <end> <end>
2.0233799829546317
<start> <start> <start> she assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her . <end> <end> <end>
2.267680861728035
<start> <start> <start> mr . hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep . <end> <end> <end>
2.082030182101816
<start> <start> <start> darcy took up a book ; miss bingley did the same ; and mrs . hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with miss bennet . <end> <end> <end>
1.680898483375417
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr . darcy ' s progress through _his_ book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . <end> <end> <end>
1.853631557484868
<start> <start> <start> she could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on . <end> <end> <end>
2.0263244149977884
<start> <start> <start> i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! <end> <end> <end>
2.0683583336993303
<start> <start> <start> no one made any reply . <end> <end> <end>
2.1157648415291748
<start> <start> <start> she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield ?-- i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure ." <end> <end> <end>
1.5773647526831251
<start> <start> <start> " if you mean darcy ," cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins -- but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9624456251362317
<start> <start> <start> it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day ." <end> <end> <end>
1.752283950693775
<start> <start> <start> " much more rational , my dear caroline , i dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2687599253959614
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.007571661827097
<start> <start> <start> her figure was elegant , and she walked well ;-- but darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious . <end> <end> <end>
1.8915401570206332
<start> <start> <start> in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to elizabeth , said , " miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room .-- i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9335780482521627
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . <end> <end> <end>
1.8800020338797536
<start> <start> <start> he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . <end> <end> <end>
1.5691901079899409
<start> <start> <start> " what could he mean ? <end> <end> <end>
2.1427131536696646
<start> <start> <start> she was dying to know what could be his meaning "-- and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? <end> <end> <end>
1.638788602754322
<start> <start> <start> " not at all ," was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8102844339882358
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr . darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives . <end> <end> <end>
2.3199797073391033
<start> <start> <start> " i have not the smallest objection to explaining them ," said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . <end> <end> <end>
2.1238655346311894
<start> <start> <start> " you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ;-- if the first , i should be completely in your way ;-- and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire ." <end> <end> <end>

2.0105149352567664

1.9196425088034652
<start> <start> <start> her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . <end> <end> <end>
2.2502581322485264
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if mr . bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well .-- against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved -- nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow mr . bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . <end> <end> <end>
1.869795599624034
<start> <start> <start> the communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred . <end> <end> <end>
1.6244487721118255
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . <end> <end> <end>
1.7461074468896587
<start> <start> <start> the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered ; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . <end> <end> <end>

1.9888910844768737
<start> <start> <start> he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it . <end> <end> <end>
1.4328253577633165
<start> <start> <start> steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her . <end> <end> <end>

1.7889673500283505
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure jane would have caught cold again .-- but their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . <end> <end> <end>

1.7509632514180022
<start> <start> <start> i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her .-- these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay ." <end> <end> <end>

1.8820624076081751
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance . <end> <end> <end>
1.755413799211904
<start> <start> <start> the subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self - conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . <end> <end> <end>
1.770709666148153
<start> <start> <start> a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self - importance and humility . <end> <end> <end>
1.7365990620638923
<start> <start> <start> having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . <end> <end> <end>
1.866780423881633
<start> <start> <start> his plan did not vary on seeing them .-- miss bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice . <end> <end> <end>
1.5487562451022383
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth -- and it was soon done -- done while mrs . bennet was stirring the fire . <end> <end> <end>
2.0007637050592497
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . <end> <end> <end>
1.614574823269622
<start> <start> <start> lydia ' s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except mary agreed to go with her ; and mr . collins was to attend them , at the request of mr . bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither mr . collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to mr . bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at hunsford . <end> <end> <end>
2.0890352160784187
<start> <start> <start> such doings discomposed mr . bennet exceedingly . <end> <end> <end>
2.6331381332535075
<start> <start> <start> in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting mr . collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and mr . collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . <end> <end> <end>
1.748135424755204
<start> <start> <start> the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_ . <end> <end> <end>
1.8819586408042246
<start> <start> <start> their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them . <end> <end> <end>
1.6632969431196685
<start> <start> <start> but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman - like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way . <end> <end> <end>
1.7903500874045826
<start> <start> <start> the officer was the very mr . denny , concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed . <end> <end> <end>
1.8037075137513465
<start> <start> <start> all were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and kitty and lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot . <end> <end> <end>
1.5396576500363754
<start> <start> <start> mr . denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , mr . wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps . <end> <end> <end>
2.061194353164383
<start> <start> <start> this was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming . <end> <end> <end>
1.975755852416193
<start> <start> <start> the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation -- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street . <end> <end> <end>
1.6415397549800712
<start> <start> <start> bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object . <end> <end> <end>
2.0044448607046466
<start> <start> <start> he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . <end> <end> <end>
2.0241651179887654
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . <end> <end> <end>
1.8986539973962324
<start> <start> <start> both changed colour , one looked white , the other red . <end> <end> <end>
1.8104436572403122
<start> <start> <start> mr . wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat -- a salutation which mr . darcy just deigned to return . <end> <end> <end>
2.075282054461135
<start> <start> <start> what could be the meaning of it ?-- it was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know . <end> <end> <end>
2.2035452856891213
<start> <start> <start> in another minute mr . bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend . <end> <end> <end>
1.85886516225035
<start> <start> <start> mr . denny and mr . wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr . philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of mrs . philips ' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation . <end> <end> <end>
2.437402982621295
<start> <start> <start> mrs . philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see mr . jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards mr . collins by jane ' s introduction of him . <end> <end> <end>
1.9999950055867681
<start> <start> <start> she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . <end> <end> <end>
1.9128698539906364
<start> <start> <start> mrs . philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr . denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant ' s commission in the ---- shire . <end> <end> <end>
1.973284433698688
<start> <start> <start> she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had mr . wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7996903010414642
<start> <start> <start> some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr . wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from longbourn would come in the evening . <end> <end> <end>
2.121316719727441
<start> <start> <start> this was agreed to , and mrs . philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . <end> <end> <end>
1.9434667649956774
<start> <start> <start> the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . <end> <end> <end>
1.940115748206088
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless . <end> <end> <end>
2.1340947704022395
<start> <start> <start> as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister . <end> <end> <end>
1.8396533760573963
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins on his return highly gratified mrs . bennet by admiring mrs . philips ' s manners and politeness . <end> <end> <end>
2.2451166797947684
<start> <start> <start> something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter xvi . <end> <end> <end>
2.2704477686791944
<start> <start> <start> as no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all mr . collins ' s scruples of leaving mr . and mrs . bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing - room , that mr . wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house . <end> <end> <end>
1.9799225688340425
<start> <start> <start> when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr . collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when mrs . philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine ' s drawing - rooms , and found that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room . <end> <end> <end>
1.7035416120252052
<start> <start> <start> in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in mrs . philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . <end> <end> <end>
1.8777259625209473
<start> <start> <start> to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle - piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . <end> <end> <end>
1.6564757606054108
<start> <start> <start> it was over at last however . <end> <end> <end>
2.0527418580676047
<start> <start> <start> the gentlemen did approach ; and when mr . wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . <end> <end> <end>
2.21418106746075
<start> <start> <start> the officers of the ---- shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman - like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but mr . wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as _they_ were superior to the broad - faced stuffy uncle philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room . <end> <end> <end>
1.6832254324794926
<start> <start> <start> mr . wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread - bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker . <end> <end> <end>
1.6780854648697419
<start> <start> <start> with such rivals for the notice of the fair , as mr . wickham and the officers , mr . collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs . philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin . <end> <end> <end>
1.9576458633701241
<start> <start> <start> when the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist . <end> <end> <end>
1.8285610098270513
<start> <start> <start> " i know little of the game , at present ," said he , " but i shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life ----" mrs . philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . <end> <end> <end>
1.807764281276789
<start> <start> <start> mr . wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia . <end> <end> <end>
1.8014068548357445
<start> <start> <start> at first there seemed danger of lydia ' s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular . <end> <end> <end>
1.6903997902675343
<start> <start> <start> allowing for the common demands of the game , mr . wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with mr . darcy . <end> <end> <end>
2.246280333739258
<start> <start> <start> she dared not even mention that gentleman . <end> <end> <end>
2.092127354174129
<start> <start> <start> her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved . <end> <end> <end>
2.006502704645272
<start> <start> <start> he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long mr . darcy had been staying there . <end> <end> <end>
1.9150364266981965
<start> <start> <start> " about a month ," said elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i understand ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2209418784032913
<start> <start> <start> " yes ," replied wickham ;--" his estate there is a noble one . <end> <end> <end>
1.8744866764127919
<start> <start> <start> a clear ten thousand per annum . <end> <end> <end>
2.00031575465702
<start> <start> <start> you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself -- for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8218402155535671
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth could not but look surprised . <end> <end> <end>
2.2278646860580964
<start> <start> <start> " you may well be surprised , miss bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday .-- are you much acquainted with mr . <end> <end> <end>
1.738621870977248
<start> <start> <start> darcy ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.4185593892974144
<start> <start> <start> " as much as i ever wish to be ," cried elizabeth warmly ,--" i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable ." <end> <end> <end>
2.333580962356148
<start> <start> <start> " i have no right to give _my_ opinion ," said wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> i am not qualified to form one . <end> <end> <end>
2.0302118371267914

2.016483568547171
<start> <start> <start> it is impossible for _me_ to be impartial . <end> <end> <end>
2.1257135284159903
<start> <start> <start> but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish -- and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else .-- here you are in your own family ." <end> <end> <end>

1.841152217656043
<start> <start> <start> " i cannot pretend to be sorry ," said wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen . <end> <end> <end>
1.8734727583541027
<start> <start> <start> the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen ." <end> <end> <end>
1.5820089751985689
<start> <start> <start> " i should take him , even on _my_ slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9887027139003404
<start> <start> <start> wickham only shook his head . <end> <end> <end>
2.322962749978013
<start> <start> <start> " i wonder ," said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> if _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_ , he must go . <end> <end> <end>
2.0135036478356776
<start> <start> <start> we are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . <end> <end> <end>
1.787811471111055
<start> <start> <start> his father , miss bennet , the late mr . darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had ; and i can never be in company with this mr . darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . <end> <end> <end>
2.2604304243452096
<start> <start> <start> his behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father ." <end> <end> <end>
1.686020776369886

2.3334709254742068
<start> <start> <start> the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr . wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball . <end> <end> <end>

1.4342314488231276
<start> <start> <start> even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr . wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia . <end> <end> <end>
1.6197490655248548
<start> <start> <start> the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her . <end> <end> <end>
1.8349952109293415

<start> <start> <start> this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .-- attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham . <end> <end> <end>
1.5877147756595797
<start> <start> <start> but elizabeth was not formed for ill - humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . <end> <end> <end>
1.9029248022293968
<start> <start> <start> the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification . <end> <end> <end>
1.8645209390265474
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give . <end> <end> <end>
1.6122879133984613
<start> <start> <start> the moment of her release from him was ecstacy . <end> <end> <end>
1.8460499132032995
<start> <start> <start> she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . <end> <end> <end>
2.191260494123902
<start> <start> <start> " i dare say you will find him very agreeable ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2665776785697305
<start> <start> <start> " heaven forbid !-- _that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all !-- to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !-- do not wish me such an evil ." <end> <end> <end>
1.5504724433640515
<start> <start> <start> when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence . <end> <end> <end>
1.9797004658019106
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr . darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it . <end> <end> <end>
1.6257572023764477
<start> <start> <start> they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance . <end> <end> <end>
1.7257790241120843
<start> <start> <start> he replied , and was again silent . <end> <end> <end>
2.969658106123876
<start> <start> <start> darcy .-- _i_ talked about the dance , and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8556747517758938
<start> <start> <start> he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . <end> <end> <end>
1.947431742917253
<start> <start> <start> " very well .-- that reply will do for the present .-- perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .-- but _now_ we may be silent ." <end> <end> <end>
1.4792547885839629
<start> <start> <start> " do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.7315053626290238
<start> <start> <start> one must speak a little , you know . <end> <end> <end>
2.289034903790667
<start> <start> <start> it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of _some_ , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible ." <end> <end> <end>
1.837962350002718
<start> <start> <start> " are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.6809724769727146
<start> <start> <start> " both ," replied elizabeth archly ; " for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .-- we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb ." <end> <end> <end>
1.6230160206562259
<start> <start> <start> " this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure ," said he . <end> <end> <end>
2.209662258347842
<start> <start> <start> " how near it may be to _mine_ , i cannot pretend to say .-- _you_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7619447189947315
<start> <start> <start> " i must not decide on my own performance ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8608123453213452
<start> <start> <start> he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton . <end> <end> <end>
2.048274037928176
<start> <start> <start> she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8299115865099038
<start> <start> <start> the effect was immediate . <end> <end> <end>
2.2811573874165125
<start> <start> <start> a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . <end> <end> <end>
1.99407310588824
<start> <start> <start> at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , " mr . wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends -- whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them , is less certain ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7547532343202565
<start> <start> <start> darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . <end> <end> <end>
1.9674533168760064
<start> <start> <start> at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr . darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . <end> <end> <end>
1.837935264442973
<start> <start> <start> " i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir . <end> <end> <end>
2.3501076698985046
<start> <start> <start> such very superior dancing is not often seen . <end> <end> <end>
1.9316298413270796
<start> <start> <start> allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing at her sister and bingley ,) shall take place . <end> <end> <end>
1.9448942132187619
<start> <start> <start> i appeal to mr . darcy :-- but let me not interrupt you , sir .-- you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7127857771924098
<start> <start> <start> the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir william ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together . <end> <end> <end>
1.7334603744692454
<start> <start> <start> recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " sir william ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0037341190602604
<start> <start> <start> " i do not think we were speaking at all . <end> <end> <end>
1.9800997196513683
<start> <start> <start> sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .-- we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine ." <end> <end> <end>
1.6953351333389515
<start> <start> <start> " what think you of books ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.056729335278166
<start> <start> <start> said he , smiling . <end> <end> <end>
2.568511009682938
<start> <start> <start> no .-- i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings ." <end> <end> <end>
2.170080011733474
<start> <start> <start> " i am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject .-- we may compare our different opinions ." <end> <end> <end>
1.713692738757155
<start> <start> <start> " the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes -- does it ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.6643429661573708
<start> <start> <start> said he , with a look of doubt . <end> <end> <end>
2.5960537833056123
<start> <start> <start> " yes , always ," she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " i remember hearing you once say , mr . darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable . <end> <end> <end>
2.004810046844992
<start> <start> <start> " i am ," said he , with a firm voice . <end> <end> <end>
2.3976273494654574
<start> <start> <start> " and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.774988402351928
<start> <start> <start> " it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7119523062399933
<start> <start> <start> " may i ask to what these questions tend ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.0388874094714313
<start> <start> <start> " i am trying to make it out ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0665354126280984
<start> <start> <start> " and what is your success ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.318835734515488
<start> <start> <start> she shook her head . <end> <end> <end>
2.345408126909118
<start> <start> <start> i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8246138272927686
<start> <start> <start> " i can readily believe ," answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either ." <end> <end> <end>
1.794496371451725
<start> <start> <start> " but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1853609258823927
<start> <start> <start> " i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours ," he coldly replied . <end> <end> <end>
1.8934373635119153
<start> <start> <start> she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another . <end> <end> <end>
1.8106405221990758
<start> <start> <start> they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham !-- your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr . darcy ' s steward . <end> <end> <end>
1.9393159112710259
<start> <start> <start> let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr . darcy ' s using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr . darcy in a most infamous manner . <end> <end> <end>
2.105867282943471
<start> <start> <start> i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr . darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . <end> <end> <end>
2.22890587947325
<start> <start> <start> his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it . <end> <end> <end>
2.2230570800409475
<start> <start> <start> i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better ." <end> <end> <end>
1.5636593441489404
<start> <start> <start> " his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same ," said elizabeth angrily ; " for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr . darcy ' s steward , and of _that_ , i can assure you , he informed me himself ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0701130676081134
<start> <start> <start> " excuse my interference .-- it was kindly meant ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9927902508605742
<start> <start> <start> " insolent girl !" <end> <end> <end>
2.4227016108945794
<start> <start> <start> said elizabeth to herself .--" you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . <end> <end> <end>
1.6050488151823121
<start> <start> <start> i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr . <end> <end> <end>
1.9552605689129092
<start> <start> <start> darcy ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4183450087749847
<start> <start> <start> she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley . <end> <end> <end>
1.9283157016399546
<start> <start> <start> jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .-- elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane ' s being in the fairest way for happiness . <end> <end> <end>
1.8130033913353432
<start> <start> <start> but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon ." <end> <end> <end>
1.95339952498109
<start> <start> <start> " no ," replied jane , " i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you . <end> <end> <end>
2.712873564615664
<start> <start> <start> " mr . bingley does not know mr . wickham himself ?" <end> <end> <end>
3.308229852451274
<start> <start> <start> " no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7189975230445318
<start> <start> <start> " this account then is what he has received from mr . darcy . <end> <end> <end>
2.1490037192275464
<start> <start> <start> i am perfectly satisfied . <end> <end> <end>
2.3710086917217104
<start> <start> <start> but what does he say of the living ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.1365533266351515
<start> <start> <start> " he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr . darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2006417885740217
<start> <start> <start> " i have not a doubt of mr . bingley ' s sincerity ," said elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . <end> <end> <end>
2.213854025855114
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7978481932670465
<start> <start> <start> she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . <end> <end> <end>
1.7338807962485507
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it . <end> <end> <end>
1.8048466768845415
<start> <start> <start> on their being joined by mr . bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr . collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . <end> <end> <end>
1.8855628604187447
<start> <start> <start> " i have found out ," said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness . <end> <end> <end>
1.964770546055112
<start> <start> <start> i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine . <end> <end> <end>
1.9031921017367357
<start> <start> <start> how wonderfully these sort of things occur ! <end> <end> <end>
1.9336024362626414
<start> <start> <start> who would have thought of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly !-- i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . <end> <end> <end>
1.624896980471077
<start> <start> <start> my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7518404281366788
<start> <start> <start> " you are not going to introduce yourself to mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.4112538834697346
<start> <start> <start> darcy ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.4185593892974144
<start> <start> <start> " indeed i am . <end> <end> <end>
2.3336622171550623
<start> <start> <start> i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . <end> <end> <end>
1.7841782279379776
<start> <start> <start> i believe him to be lady catherine ' s _nephew_ . <end> <end> <end>
2.459891951766843
<start> <start> <start> it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ' night ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9497601945212055
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that mr . darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr . darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .-- mr . <end> <end> <end>
1.8436381032600846
<start> <start> <start> collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . <end> <end> <end>
1.560507000083577
<start> <start> <start> you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty . <end> <end> <end>
1.5922328670407473
<start> <start> <start> pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself ." <end> <end> <end>
1.4911160874171374
<start> <start> <start> and with a low bow he left her to attack mr . darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident . <end> <end> <end>
1.7440902818250386
<start> <start> <start> her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words " apology ," " hunsford ," and " lady catherine de bourgh ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9739869692024385
<start> <start> <start> -- it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man . <end> <end> <end>
2.2761428940295687
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr . collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . <end> <end> <end>
2.0086657742181386
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr . darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way . <end> <end> <end>
2.0903636882150507
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins then returned to elizabeth . <end> <end> <end>
2.1747286012506786
<start> <start> <start> " i have no reason , i assure you ," said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception . <end> <end> <end>
2.215544614541313
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . <end> <end> <end>
2.199648385153515
<start> <start> <start> he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . <end> <end> <end>
2.017697142487589
<start> <start> <start> it was really a very handsome thought . <end> <end> <end>
2.3455754541225566
<start> <start> <start> as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr . bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane . <end> <end> <end>
1.8864623552978188
<start> <start> <start> her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much . <end> <end> <end>
1.8198830903905003
<start> <start> <start> when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> bingley .-- it was an animating subject , and mrs . bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match . <end> <end> <end>
2.2018351778903518
<start> <start> <start> his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self - gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do . <end> <end> <end>
2.067054392360493
<start> <start> <start> it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . <end> <end> <end>
1.833691497873274
<start> <start> <start> it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs . bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . <end> <end> <end>
1.724698120948711
<start> <start> <start> she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it . <end> <end> <end>
1.631208037845556
<start> <start> <start> in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr . darcy , who sat opposite to them . <end> <end> <end>
1.8584787191116507
<start> <start> <start> her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical . <end> <end> <end>
1.8636045318818255
<start> <start> <start> " what is mr . darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ? <end> <end> <end>
2.926153258945807
<start> <start> <start> " for heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower .-- what advantage can it be to you to offend mr . <end> <end> <end>
1.7752271973049962
<start> <start> <start> darcy ?-- you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing ." <end> <end> <end>
1.817525435351939
<start> <start> <start> nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . <end> <end> <end>
2.7417629839565536
<start> <start> <start> her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . <end> <end> <end>
1.9796935931963449
<start> <start> <start> she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr . darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . <end> <end> <end>
2.127123577871142
<start> <start> <start> the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity . <end> <end> <end>
1.5681480164162676
<start> <start> <start> at length however mrs . bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken . <end> <end> <end>
1.7425400736479133
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth now began to revive . <end> <end> <end>
2.1335645270975814
<start> <start> <start> by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance ,-- but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song . <end> <end> <end>
1.687680635409887
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another . <end> <end> <end>
1.5927520440989642
<start> <start> <start> she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley . <end> <end> <end>
2.067163158186243
<start> <start> <start> she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave . <end> <end> <end>
2.073626453136167
<start> <start> <start> he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " that will do extremely well , child . <end> <end> <end>
1.9541566914572148
<start> <start> <start> you have delighted us long enough . <end> <end> <end>
2.0148705570775154
<start> <start> <start> let the other young ladies have time to exhibit ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8882339553408647
<start> <start> <start> mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .-- others of the party were now applied to . <end> <end> <end>
1.8842853390338332
<start> <start> <start> he must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible . <end> <end> <end>
1.8396513598383033
<start> <start> <start> and with a bow to mr . darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .-- many stared .-- many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr . bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr . collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half - whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . <end> <end> <end>
1.8476676759893134
<start> <start> <start> to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . <end> <end> <end>
1.743810123127549
<start> <start> <start> that his two sisters and mr . darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . <end> <end> <end>
2.200296610684508
<start> <start> <start> she was teazed by mr . collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . <end> <end> <end>
2.171064034917375
<start> <start> <start> he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . <end> <end> <end>
2.03134342577201
<start> <start> <start> there was no arguing upon such a project . <end> <end> <end>
2.039176162338134
<start> <start> <start> she was at least free from the offence of mr . darcy ' s farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . <end> <end> <end>
1.8123534164955175
<start> <start> <start> she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr . wickham , and rejoiced in it . <end> <end> <end>
2.210776596466265
<start> <start> <start> the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mrs . bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . <end> <end> <end>
1.7611341220300143
<start> <start> <start> mrs . hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . <end> <end> <end>
1.811880058532633
<start> <start> <start> darcy said nothing at all . <end> <end> <end>
2.2411580426692708
<start> <start> <start> mr . bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . <end> <end> <end>
1.9167544481833307
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . <end> <end> <end>
1.9351230722542818
<start> <start> <start> accompanied by a violent yawn . <end> <end> <end>
2.2089904703829957
<start> <start> <start> when at length they arose to take leave , mrs . bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr . bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . <end> <end> <end>
1.8466775936820952
<start> <start> <start> bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . <end> <end> <end>
1.9415274133838671
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months . <end> <end> <end>
1.659158810923265
<start> <start> <start> of having another daughter married to mr . collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . <end> <end> <end>
2.2286259414056335
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_ , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr . bingley and netherfield . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter xix . <end> <end> <end>
2.2704477686791944
<start> <start> <start> the next day opened a new scene at longbourn . <end> <end> <end>
2.079219995691106
<start> <start> <start> on finding mrs . bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.193581798792432
<start> <start> <start> before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs . bennet instantly answered , " oh dear !-- yes -- certainly .-- i am sure lizzy will be very happy -- i am sure she can have no objection .-- come , kitty , i want you up stairs ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0061536032578604
<start> <start> <start> and gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when elizabeth called out , " dear ma ' am , do not go .-- i beg you will not go .-- mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.0956232430606745
<start> <start> <start> " no , no , nonsense , lizzy .-- i desire you will stay where you are ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7685991049198038
<start> <start> <start> -- and upon elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " lizzy , i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr . <end> <end> <end>
1.716947500516187
<start> <start> <start> collins ." <end> <end> <end>
2.655862184606757
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction -- and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion . <end> <end> <end>
1.6626343278118942
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr . collins began . <end> <end> <end>
2.5427169828436007
<start> <start> <start> " believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections . <end> <end> <end>
1.8812739080730605
<start> <start> <start> you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother ' s permission for this address . <end> <end> <end>
1.8916217245822984
<start> <start> <start> you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . <end> <end> <end>
1.485438123142601
<start> <start> <start> almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life . <end> <end> <end>
1.9220015358774662
<start> <start> <start> but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as i certainly did ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7287166800312204
<start> <start> <start> the idea of mr . collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : " my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish . <end> <end> <end>
1.7196143112000615
<start> <start> <start> twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too !) <end> <end> <end>
1.9214512560697143
<start> <start> <start> on this subject ; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford -- between our pools at quadrille , while mrs . jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh ' s foot - stool , that she said , ' mr . <end> <end> <end>
1.9347338970840238
<start> <start> <start> collins , you must marry . <end> <end> <end>
2.900847892679315
<start> <start> <start> a clergyman like you must marry .-- chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake ; and for your _own_ , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . <end> <end> <end>
1.4046853102648198
<start> <start> <start> this is my advice . <end> <end> <end>
2.253736477576967
<start> <start> <start> allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . <end> <end> <end>
2.118724351393514
<start> <start> <start> you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite . <end> <end> <end>
1.5423760420812442
<start> <start> <start> thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women . <end> <end> <end>
1.6048714493047156
<start> <start> <start> but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer ,) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years . <end> <end> <end>
1.856403657992356
<start> <start> <start> and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . <end> <end> <end>
1.7491387020623799
<start> <start> <start> to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the <number> per cents . <end> <end> <end>
1.7837443004071263
<start> <start> <start> which will not be yours till after your mother ' s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . <end> <end> <end>
2.017150417000378
<start> <start> <start> on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married ." <end> <end> <end>
1.974615886454632
<start> <start> <start> it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . <end> <end> <end>
1.8864111051561554
<start> <start> <start> " you are too hasty , sir ," she cried . <end> <end> <end>
2.070043859613652
<start> <start> <start> " you forget that i have made no answer . <end> <end> <end>
2.2734670242518273
<start> <start> <start> let me do it without farther loss of time . <end> <end> <end>
1.8402927122700241
<start> <start> <start> i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them ." <end> <end> <end>
2.293561328162307
<start> <start> <start> " i am not now to learn ," replied mr . collins , with a formal wave of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . <end> <end> <end>
1.7877764817445114
<start> <start> <start> i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9095944314495112
<start> <start> <start> " upon my word , sir ," cried elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . <end> <end> <end>
1.896159422509279
<start> <start> <start> i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . <end> <end> <end>
1.566339377805863
<start> <start> <start> and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications ." <end> <end> <end>
1.951502283129157
<start> <start> <start> you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say . <end> <end> <end>
1.857934781426567
<start> <start> <start> i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . <end> <end> <end>
1.8154524690578668
<start> <start> <start> in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach . <end> <end> <end>
1.8547677778979055
<start> <start> <start> this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled ." <end> <end> <end>
2.236308643887122
<start> <start> <start> and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr . collins thus addressed her , " when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7639656097570553
<start> <start> <start> if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one ." <end> <end> <end>
1.803667117009456
<start> <start> <start> " you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . <end> <end> <end>
1.874954896439381
<start> <start> <start> my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . <end> <end> <end>
1.7389782840923453
<start> <start> <start> your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . <end> <end> <end>
1.5815080847484237
<start> <start> <start> as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7396150792063374
<start> <start> <start> i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . <end> <end> <end>
1.9004140493402661
<start> <start> <start> i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . <end> <end> <end>
1.8492955176687194
<start> <start> <start> my feelings in every respect forbid it . <end> <end> <end>
2.1777428550894222
<start> <start> <start> can i speak plainer ? <end> <end> <end>
2.2684385524441746
<start> <start> <start> do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart ." <end> <end> <end>
1.6977965491376132
<start> <start> <start> " you are uniformly charming !" <end> <end> <end>
2.1071599355834514
<start> <start> <start> cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable ." <end> <end> <end>
1.6912743029579118
<start> <start> <start> to such perseverance in wilful self - deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> mr . collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs . bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast - room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . <end> <end> <end>
1.5819766929610672
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . <end> <end> <end>
1.6480899964766138
<start> <start> <start> this information , however , startled mrs . bennet ;-- she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so . <end> <end> <end>

1.6933445859630247
<start> <start> <start> as for the gentleman himself , _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . <end> <end> <end>
1.4884015148272032
<start> <start> <start> he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend . <end> <end> <end>

2.0502333704572937
<start> <start> <start> he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over .-- to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed . <end> <end> <end>
1.988252067661854
<start> <start> <start> " i found ," said he , " as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr . darcy ;-- that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1193374465082986
<start> <start> <start> she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her . <end> <end> <end>
1.7889981465321083
<start> <start> <start> his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . <end> <end> <end>
1.8474130214167706
<start> <start> <start> the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . <end> <end> <end>
1.76131123387149
<start> <start> <start> jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs . <end> <end> <end>
1.611499650293122
<start> <start> <start> when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , " this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal . <end> <end> <end>

2.293360746643118

1.5874542371433777

2.121672740887839
<start> <start> <start> to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr . bingley ' s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " you must decide for yourself ," said elizabeth , " and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him ." <end> <end> <end>
1.724535447446659

1.8684616206699045
<start> <start> <start> the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt . <end> <end> <end>
1.9804442671373879
<start> <start> <start> it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one . <end> <end> <end>
1.765732108770742
<start> <start> <start> she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . <end> <end> <end>
2.0917982449695742
<start> <start> <start> jane ' s temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . <end> <end> <end>
1.8720050611089323
<start> <start> <start> they agreed that mrs . bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together . <end> <end> <end>
2.003597024415652
<start> <start> <start> after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr . bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter xxii . <end> <end> <end>
2.631248584311367
<start> <start> <start> the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr . collins . <end> <end> <end>
2.2073088597256647
<start> <start> <start> charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . <end> <end> <end>
1.829385862316686
<start> <start> <start> this was very amiable , but charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of ;-- its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of mr . collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . <end> <end> <end>
1.6329237275958244
<start> <start> <start> such was miss lucas ' s scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon . <end> <end> <end>
1.810776436614454
<start> <start> <start> but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet . <end> <end> <end>
1.6590239874415893
<start> <start> <start> he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday . <end> <end> <end>
1.6397086701365131
<start> <start> <start> miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . <end> <end> <end>
1.898866809217028
<start> <start> <start> in as short a time as mr . collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . <end> <end> <end>
1.874032679918284
<start> <start> <start> sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . <end> <end> <end>
1.8965543343418598
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair . <end> <end> <end>
1.6633986207994544
<start> <start> <start> lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr . bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr . collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st . james ' s . <end> <end> <end>
1.696861528137059
<start> <start> <start> the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion . <end> <end> <end>
2.0075262296364462
<start> <start> <start> the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte ' s dying an old maid . <end> <end> <end>
1.680250141621939
<start> <start> <start> charlotte herself was tolerably composed . <end> <end> <end>
2.0924600672032545
<start> <start> <start> she had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . <end> <end> <end>
2.0825612630736106
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . <end> <end> <end>
1.851459661132076
<start> <start> <start> but still he would be her husband .-- without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well - educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want . <end> <end> <end>
1.5628359438588957
<start> <start> <start> this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty - seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . <end> <end> <end>
1.767410453029226
<start> <start> <start> the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person . <end> <end> <end>
1.736405902079228
<start> <start> <start> she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr . collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . <end> <end> <end>
2.120874627255934
<start> <start> <start> a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self - denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love . <end> <end> <end>
1.6368484509703016
<start> <start> <start> as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs . bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . <end> <end> <end>
1.6989184266708721
<start> <start> <start> " my dear madam ," he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible ." <end> <end> <end>
2.178599426856762
<start> <start> <start> they were all astonished ; and mr . bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " but is there not danger of lady catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ?-- you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8185898678660881
<start> <start> <start> " my dear sir ," replied mr . collins , " i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ' s concurrence ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1326260369311023
<start> <start> <start> " you cannot be too much on your guard . <end> <end> <end>
2.1360027418388485
<start> <start> <start> risk any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8552103597714473
<start> <start> <start> " believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire . <end> <end> <end>
1.7368527595227494
<start> <start> <start> as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8448893234503019
<start> <start> <start> with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . <end> <end> <end>
1.669152497140753
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . <end> <end> <end>
2.0126872608958797
<start> <start> <start> she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion . <end> <end> <end>
1.89611857430758
<start> <start> <start> but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away . <end> <end> <end>
1.8952085016662803
<start> <start> <start> miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before . <end> <end> <end>
2.076411496251993
<start> <start> <start> the possibility of mr . collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " engaged to mr . collins ! <end> <end> <end>
2.018418017538666
<start> <start> <start> my dear charlotte ,-- impossible !" <end> <end> <end>
2.183299659702168
<start> <start> <start> the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , " why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ?-- do you think it incredible that mr . collins should be able to procure any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.899830702179606
<start> <start> <start> but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . <end> <end> <end>
1.942236433413336
<start> <start> <start> " i see what you are feeling ," replied charlotte ,--" you must be surprised , very much surprised ,-- so lately as mr . collins was wishing to marry you . <end> <end> <end>
1.925454740548119
<start> <start> <start> i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering mr . collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8356331457118475
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth quietly answered " undoubtedly ;"-- and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . <end> <end> <end>
1.7832064508084924
<start> <start> <start> charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . <end> <end> <end>
2.0416703723585314
<start> <start> <start> it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match . <end> <end> <end>
1.7584272809075563
<start> <start> <start> the strangeness of mr . collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . <end> <end> <end>
1.89161633012583
<start> <start> <start> charlotte the wife of mr . collins , was a most humiliating picture !-- and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen . <end> <end> <end>
1.7508830333564904
<start> <start> <start> chapter xxiii . <end> <end> <end>
2.631248584311367
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . <end> <end> <end>
1.709233929891948
<start> <start> <start> with many compliments to them , and much self - gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter ,-- to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs . bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , " good lord ! <end> <end> <end>
1.6196465970833323
<start> <start> <start> sir william , how can you tell such a story ?-- do not you know that mr . collins wants to marry lizzy ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.2384553711696573
<start> <start> <start> in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr . collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off . <end> <end> <end>
2.0163440068573513
<start> <start> <start> two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . <end> <end> <end>
2.0987506102797098
<start> <start> <start> nothing could console and nothing appease her .-- nor did that day wear out her resentment . <end> <end> <end>
1.5634157983273826
<start> <start> <start> mr . bennet ' s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! <end> <end> <end>
1.8492330304586093
<start> <start> <start> jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . <end> <end> <end>
1.653883015873277
<start> <start> <start> kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr . collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton . <end> <end> <end>
1.8256051087799818
<start> <start> <start> lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs . bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs . bennet ' s sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . <end> <end> <end>
1.9706670294559128
<start> <start> <start> between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again . <end> <end> <end>
1.8598628144620988
<start> <start> <start> her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . <end> <end> <end>
1.6730171377074197
<start> <start> <start> the promised letter of thanks from mr . collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have prompted . <end> <end> <end>
1.890654115870796
<start> <start> <start> after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . <end> <end> <end>
1.7570044713087039
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins ' s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs . bennet . <end> <end> <end>
2.2710590618984794
<start> <start> <start> on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .-- it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .-- she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . <end> <end> <end>
1.6919669074199468
<start> <start> <start> such were the gentle murmurs of mrs . bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr . bingley ' s continued absence . <end> <end> <end>
2.2473757923315634
<start> <start> <start> neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . <end> <end> <end>
2.0812449102953727
<start> <start> <start> day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs . bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . <end> <end> <end>
1.6006196962856394
<start> <start> <start> even elizabeth began to fear -- not that bingley was indifferent -- but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . <end> <end> <end>
1.6378294066074595
<start> <start> <start> unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane ' s happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring . <end> <end> <end>
1.998355107247173
<start> <start> <start> the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment . <end> <end> <end>
1.9028732876452175
<start> <start> <start> as for jane , _her_ anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . <end> <end> <end>
1.7614947149378002
<start> <start> <start> but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used . <end> <end> <end>
1.878609247062898
<start> <start> <start> it needed all jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . <end> <end> <end>
1.8239700103483978
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction . <end> <end> <end>
1.8074368967294945
<start> <start> <start> he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love - making relieved them from a great deal of his company . <end> <end> <end>
1.828848530206683
<start> <start> <start> the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed . <end> <end> <end>
1.8078311222047838
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet was really in a most pitiable state . <end> <end> <end>
2.0067467664246137
<start> <start> <start> the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . <end> <end> <end>
1.591476017512146
<start> <start> <start> as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . <end> <end> <end>
1.6889231149708277
<start> <start> <start> whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr . collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr . bennet were dead . <end> <end> <end>
2.114903183474391
<start> <start> <start> she complained bitterly of all this to her husband . <end> <end> <end>
2.129952123362415
<start> <start> <start> " indeed , mr . bennet ," said she , " it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for _her_ , and live to see her take my place in it !" <end> <end> <end>

1.9617499211321017
<start> <start> <start> this was not very consoling to mrs . bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate . <end> <end> <end>
2.6269803043688555

2.3754841575759227
<start> <start> <start> how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters i cannot understand ; and all for the sake of mr . collins too !-- why should _he_ have it more than anybody else ?" <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter i . miss bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . <end> <end> <end>
2.163603557057744
<start> <start> <start> the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter , and concluded with her brother ' s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country . <end> <end> <end>
1.6738295958303964
<start> <start> <start> miss darcy ' s praise occupied the chief of it . <end> <end> <end>
2.546574908895905
<start> <start> <start> her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . <end> <end> <end>
1.5223314351325627
<start> <start> <start> she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an inmate of mr . darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture . <end> <end> <end>
1.996019972474267
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . <end> <end> <end>
2.107018300340646
<start> <start> <start> her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others . <end> <end> <end>
2.157355078708945
<start> <start> <start> to caroline ' s assertion of her brother ' s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit . <end> <end> <end>
2.014736871757651
<start> <start> <start> that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . <end> <end> <end>
1.7773492833352025
<start> <start> <start> had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . <end> <end> <end>
2.107230348114714
<start> <start> <start> it was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . <end> <end> <end>
1.8339507907392159
<start> <start> <start> a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ; but at last on mrs . bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " oh ! <end> <end> <end>
1.998234717239683
<start> <start> <start> that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . <end> <end> <end>
1.6401641544435916
<start> <start> <start> it cannot last long . <end> <end> <end>
2.2349418516926587
<start> <start> <start> he will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before ." <end> <end> <end>
2.047466667760825
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . <end> <end> <end>
2.0595802348293986
<start> <start> <start> " you doubt me ," cried jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all . <end> <end> <end>
2.0417930138250266

2.681508021286018
<start> <start> <start> i have not _that_ pain . <end> <end> <end>
2.228900047820906
<start> <start> <start> a little time therefore .-- i shall certainly try to get the better ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9492920816797983
<start> <start> <start> with a stronger voice she soon added , " i have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself ." <end> <end> <end>
2.110804506110458
<start> <start> <start> " my dear jane !" <end> <end> <end>
2.4840878207791044
<start> <start> <start> your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; i do not know what to say to you . <end> <end> <end>
2.0949114930901205
<start> <start> <start> i feel as if i had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7679751696572168
<start> <start> <start> miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ' s warm affection . <end> <end> <end>
1.7725647920682672
<start> <start> <start> " nay ," said elizabeth , " this is not fair . <end> <end> <end>
2.735992723686713

2.656594647205796

1.8386930699613775
<start> <start> <start> the more i see of the world , the more am i dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . <end> <end> <end>
1.740135854090222
<start> <start> <start> it is unaccountable ! <end> <end> <end>
2.543495606165367
<start> <start> <start> in every view it is unaccountable !" <end> <end> <end>
2.135746341586854
<start> <start> <start> " my dear lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . <end> <end> <end>

2.155628190605429

1.9287432948890655
<start> <start> <start> " to oblige you , i would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him , i should only think worse of her understanding , than i now do of her heart . <end> <end> <end>
1.7505922510405119
<start> <start> <start> my dear jane , mr . collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as i do ; and you must feel , as well as i do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking . <end> <end> <end>
1.9159083222824418
<start> <start> <start> you shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness ." <end> <end> <end>
1.5698879747702392
<start> <start> <start> " i must think your language too strong in speaking of both ," replied jane , " and i hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . <end> <end> <end>

2.3195783450426117

1.8530049173889287
<start> <start> <start> we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . <end> <end> <end>
2.115923240678988

1.8562648828245891
<start> <start> <start> " i am far from attributing any part of mr . bingley ' s conduct to design ," said elizabeth ; " but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . <end> <end> <end>
2.0236396081865524
<start> <start> <start> thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business ." <end> <end> <end>

1.9322026435888449

<start> <start> <start> " your first position is false . <end> <end> <end>
1.9682063087672086
<start> <start> <start> they may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride ." <end> <end> <end>
1.5590444265172396
<start> <start> <start> " beyond a doubt , they _do_ wish him to chuse miss darcy ," replied jane ; " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . <end> <end> <end>

2.000613479924085
<start> <start> <start> i am not ashamed of having been mistaken -- or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . <end> <end> <end>
2.030834571672374
<start> <start> <start> let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood ." <end> <end> <end>
2.135442252527246
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time mr . bingley ' s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . <end> <end> <end>
2.063791941500785
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . <end> <end> <end>
1.709638019917196
<start> <start> <start> her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . <end> <end> <end>
1.7537871973987926
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet ' s best comfort was , that mr . bingley must be down again in the summer . <end> <end> <end>
2.1317196476394065
<start> <start> <start> mr . bennet treated the matter differently . <end> <end> <end>
2.17824657722022
<start> <start> <start> " so , lizzy ," said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love i find . <end> <end> <end>
2.3437254509814185
<start> <start> <start> i congratulate her . <end> <end> <end>
2.4512103236087324
<start> <start> <start> next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . <end> <end> <end>
1.7503939423641912
<start> <start> <start> it is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . <end> <end> <end>
1.8450492226170778
<start> <start> <start> when is your turn to come ? <end> <end> <end>
2.177980447891876
<start> <start> <start> you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane . <end> <end> <end>
1.9552473066088005
<start> <start> <start> here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> let wickham be _your_ man . <end> <end> <end>
2.125333594867378
<start> <start> <start> he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably ." <end> <end> <end>
2.217714162031978
<start> <start> <start> " thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . <end> <end> <end>
1.9652284502524262
<start> <start> <start> we must not all expect jane ' s good fortune ." <end> <end> <end>
2.370249137101523
<start> <start> <start> " true ," said mr . bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0466007760966316
<start> <start> <start> mr . wickham ' s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family . <end> <end> <end>
1.8137453161695092
<start> <start> <start> they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve . <end> <end> <end>
1.9472476051035756
<start> <start> <start> the whole of what elizabeth had already heard , his claims on mr . darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr . darcy before they had known any thing of the matter . <end> <end> <end>
2.2609057459740103
<start> <start> <start> miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes -- but by everybody else mr . darcy was condemned as the worst of men . <end> <end> <end>

2.2704477686791944
<start> <start> <start> after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , mr . collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday . <end> <end> <end>
1.8199975922274778
<start> <start> <start> the pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . <end> <end> <end>
1.7905315885759605
<start> <start> <start> he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks . <end> <end> <end>
1.7335283803069768
<start> <start> <start> mr . gardiner was a sensible , gentleman - like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . <end> <end> <end>
2.0735631072480163
<start> <start> <start> mrs . gardiner , who was several years younger than mrs . bennet and mrs . philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces . <end> <end> <end>
2.104958270677658
<start> <start> <start> between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . <end> <end> <end>
1.798965972650205
<start> <start> <start> they had frequently been staying with her in town . <end> <end> <end>
1.9241723265113087
<start> <start> <start> the first part of mrs . gardiner ' s business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions . <end> <end> <end>
1.8744292046505913
<start> <start> <start> when this was done , she had a less active part to play . <end> <end> <end>
2.143320853486623
<start> <start> <start> it became her turn to listen . <end> <end> <end>
2.110485851836326
<start> <start> <start> they had all been very ill - used since she last saw her sister . <end> <end> <end>
1.8106675833362984
<start> <start> <start> " i do not blame jane ," she continued , " for jane would have got mr . bingley , if she could . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> oh , sister ! <end> <end> <end>
2.443690650272499

2.2423339271167295
<start> <start> <start> it makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . <end> <end> <end>
1.9697939423457846
<start> <start> <start> mrs . gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of jane and elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation . <end> <end> <end>
2.3329844331114327

<start> <start> <start> poor jane ! <end> <end> <end>
2.600703869744946
<start> <start> <start> i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . <end> <end> <end>
2.0377128669482665
<start> <start> <start> it had better have happened to _you_ , lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . <end> <end> <end>
1.8492336652438486
<start> <start> <start> but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? <end> <end> <end>
2.093132400561824
<start> <start> <start> change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7842288589320932
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready acquiescence . <end> <end> <end>
1.8769122435979084
<start> <start> <start> " i hope ," added mrs . gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . <end> <end> <end>
2.1007173633079983
<start> <start> <start> we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8314277412441893
<start> <start> <start> " and _that_ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr . darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london ! <end> <end> <end>
2.0625259051435854
<start> <start> <start> my dear aunt , how could you think of it ? <end> <end> <end>
2.249211215350665
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month ' s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , mr . bingley never stirs without him ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7579356549560354
<start> <start> <start> " so much the better . <end> <end> <end>
1.9768989067206024

<start> <start> <start> " she will drop the acquaintance entirely ." <end> <end> <end>
1.951444376007363
<start> <start> <start> but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley ' s being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . <end> <end> <end>
2.007070661301498
<start> <start> <start> it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re - animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane ' s attractions . <end> <end> <end>
1.864366931530731
<start> <start> <start> miss bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . <end> <end> <end>
1.9242551049199372
<start> <start> <start> the gardiners staid a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . <end> <end> <end>
2.2532626446055875
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . <end> <end> <end>
2.0255731417278526
<start> <start> <start> when the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers mr . wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , mrs . gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . <end> <end> <end>
2.136850184550383
<start> <start> <start> without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment . <end> <end> <end>
2.0200360675277325
<start> <start> <start> to mrs . gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . <end> <end> <end>
1.991668331166284
<start> <start> <start> about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire , to which he belonged . <end> <end> <end>
1.8682565849086035
<start> <start> <start> mrs . gardiner had seen pemberley , and known the late mr . darcy by character perfectly well . <end> <end> <end>
2.072526295504598
<start> <start> <start> here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse . <end> <end> <end>
1.8716423138444935
<start> <start> <start> on being made acquainted with the present mr . darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard mr . fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill - natured boy . <end> <end> <end>
1.8912211190953738
<start> <start> <start> mrs . gardiner ' s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : " you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly . <end> <end> <end>
1.8667722546918886

1.8427732462897344
<start> <start> <start> his marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill - natured tone that she " _wished_ they might be happy ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8261610064944018
<start> <start> <start> thursday was to be the wedding day , and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . <end> <end> <end>
1.8979613480196262
<start> <start> <start> as they went down stairs together , charlotte said , " i shall depend on hearing from you very often , eliza ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0172353644695775
<start> <start> <start> " _that_ you certainly shall ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " my father and maria are to come to me in march ," added charlotte , " and i hope you will consent to be of the party . <end> <end> <end>
2.176579685681952
<start> <start> <start> indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them ." <end> <end> <end>
2.261699351139833
<start> <start> <start> the wedding took place ; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . <end> <end> <end>
1.8210392890484726
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . <end> <end> <end>
1.7397479464015826
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was . <end> <end> <end>
2.134458426682938
<start> <start> <start> charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . <end> <end> <end>
1.7665615873244147
<start> <start> <start> she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . <end> <end> <end>
1.8297581358101351
<start> <start> <start> the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . <end> <end> <end>
2.1095092693219213
<start> <start> <start> it was mr . collins ' s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest . <end> <end> <end>
1.933253332689774
<start> <start> <start> her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is . <end> <end> <end>
1.7448007548226743
<start> <start> <start> jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from caroline . <end> <end> <end>
2.049058708390735
<start> <start> <start> she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some accident been lost . <end> <end> <end>
1.900005114735701
<start> <start> <start> " my aunt ," she continued , " is going to - morrow into that part of the town , and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor - street ." <end> <end> <end>
2.269286605744303
<start> <start> <start> she wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen miss bingley . <end> <end> <end>
2.1900421590480303
<start> <start> <start> " i did not think caroline in spirits ," were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london . <end> <end> <end>
1.9835153054095032
<start> <start> <start> i enquired after their brother , of course . <end> <end> <end>
2.3396158778473914
<start> <start> <start> he was well , but so much engaged with mr . darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him . <end> <end> <end>
2.3921738026950354

<start> <start> <start> i dare say i shall soon see them here ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1431563099139956
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth shook her head over this letter . <end> <end> <end>
2.1636218741148574
<start> <start> <start> it convinced her , that accident only could discover to mr . bingley her sister ' s being in town . <end> <end> <end>
2.4199003359551945
<start> <start> <start> she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley ' s inattention . <end> <end> <end>
2.38425364568516
<start> <start> <start> after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer . <end> <end> <end>
1.5692940242280053
<start> <start> <start> the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " my dearest lizzy will , i am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley ' s regard for me . <end> <end> <end>
1.8730317943533334
<start> <start> <start> i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceived again . <end> <end> <end>
1.8540113608336364
<start> <start> <start> i pity , though i cannot help blaming her . <end> <end> <end>
2.178306654208265
<start> <start> <start> she was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; i can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . <end> <end> <end>
1.6707862906180126
<start> <start> <start> but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . <end> <end> <end>
1.7413298627382678
<start> <start> <start> i cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . <end> <end> <end>
1.9073884610696266
<start> <start> <start> i cannot understand it . <end> <end> <end>
2.3585226811845157
<start> <start> <start> if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> let me hear from you very soon . <end> <end> <end>

2.6052532894010816
<start> <start> <start> " your ' s , & c ." this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . <end> <end> <end>

2.1007802227671535
<start> <start> <start> his character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr . darcy ' s sister , as , by wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away . <end> <end> <end>
2.1517541350915663
<start> <start> <start> his apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else . <end> <end> <end>
1.9127171636795077
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . <end> <end> <end>
1.9194182815212142
<start> <start> <start> her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . <end> <end> <end>
1.8596015236790233
<start> <start> <start> nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy . <end> <end> <end>
1.7991048028303944

<start> <start> <start> the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay . <end> <end> <end>
2.1098668324693572
<start> <start> <start> every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to charlotte ' s first sketch . <end> <end> <end>
2.402773368287001
<start> <start> <start> she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter . <end> <end> <end>
2.196364407730521
<start> <start> <start> the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be . <end> <end> <end>
1.9876668838788156
<start> <start> <start> the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter . <end> <end> <end>
2.1211059843227016
<start> <start> <start> the farewell between herself and mr . wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more . <end> <end> <end>
2.1939210165390937
<start> <start> <start> his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of every body -- would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . <end> <end> <end>
1.6394590592368534
<start> <start> <start> her fellow - travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . <end> <end> <end>
1.9938885169980065
<start> <start> <start> sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty - headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise . <end> <end> <end>
1.8505605383886963
<start> <start> <start> he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information . <end> <end> <end>
1.5728546405505472
<start> <start> <start> as they drove to mr . gardiner ' s door , jane was at a drawing - room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever . <end> <end> <end>
2.009477322976742
<start> <start> <start> on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing - room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . <end> <end> <end>
1.7655221766083495
<start> <start> <start> all was joy and kindness . <end> <end> <end>
2.1224557076291326
<start> <start> <start> the day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres . <end> <end> <end>
2.051675444185206
<start> <start> <start> their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection . <end> <end> <end>
1.7879401988465722
<start> <start> <start> it was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long . <end> <end> <end>
2.627755165736641
<start> <start> <start> mrs . gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham ' s desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well . <end> <end> <end>

1.7282726640711727
<start> <start> <start> chapter v . every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . <end> <end> <end>
1.9217970744841057
<start> <start> <start> when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view . <end> <end> <end>
1.6309017383741402
<start> <start> <start> the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side . <end> <end> <end>
1.891776503776302
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants . <end> <end> <end>
2.331973579653462
<start> <start> <start> at length the parsonage was discernible . <end> <end> <end>
1.985745916562702
<start> <start> <start> the garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving . <end> <end> <end>
1.6689106557168665
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins and charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party . <end> <end> <end>
1.9995533291911622
<start> <start> <start> in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . <end> <end> <end>
2.4550742340352762
<start> <start> <start> mrs . collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . <end> <end> <end>
1.9468242363657071
<start> <start> <start> she saw instantly that her cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family . <end> <end> <end>
1.7771875883572434
<start> <start> <start> they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment . <end> <end> <end>
1.6898418988983717
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . <end> <end> <end>
2.098147366381741
<start> <start> <start> but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion . <end> <end> <end>
1.6795414084391111
<start> <start> <start> when mr . collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte . <end> <end> <end>
1.7086222493439442
<start> <start> <start> after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , mr . collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself . <end> <end> <end>
1.987275670669008
<start> <start> <start> to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible . <end> <end> <end>
1.622891706637365
<start> <start> <start> he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump . <end> <end> <end>
1.7221405532346736
<start> <start> <start> but of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . <end> <end> <end>
1.681058477304186
<start> <start> <start> it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . <end> <end> <end>
1.7891106353559802
<start> <start> <start> it was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit . <end> <end> <end>
1.5460991919975662
<start> <start> <start> when mr . collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten . <end> <end> <end>
2.0661362531249807
<start> <start> <start> it was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when mr . collins joining in , observed , " yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will be delighted with her . <end> <end> <end>
2.1513845224260266
<start> <start> <start> she is all affability and condescension , and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . <end> <end> <end>
1.9218074869375077
<start> <start> <start> i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . <end> <end> <end>
1.4564796692560207
<start> <start> <start> her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming . <end> <end> <end>
2.1357475776183623
<start> <start> <start> we dine at rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . <end> <end> <end>
1.8089884497047084
<start> <start> <start> her ladyship ' s carriage is regularly ordered for us . <end> <end> <end>
2.015225597421529
<start> <start> <start> i _should_ say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several ." <end> <end> <end>
2.338103774734012
<start> <start> <start> " very true , my dear , that is exactly what i say . <end> <end> <end>
2.2148833336687246
<start> <start> <start> she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8096417329309225
<start> <start> <start> the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . <end> <end> <end>
1.6813432043543135
<start> <start> <start> she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of mr . collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings . <end> <end> <end>
1.7517793594218707
<start> <start> <start> a lively imagination soon settled it all . <end> <end> <end>
1.9705180813579923
<start> <start> <start> she opened the door , and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " oh , my dear eliza ! <end> <end> <end>
2.122871444608698
<start> <start> <start> pray make haste and come into the dining - room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! <end> <end> <end>
2.1823283591280735
<start> <start> <start> i will not tell you what it is . <end> <end> <end>
2.3131202478439277
<start> <start> <start> make haste , and come down this moment ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0432381504898722
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth asked questions in vain ; maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining - room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . <end> <end> <end>
1.7886943138703528
<start> <start> <start> " and is this all ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.1175201687623706

<start> <start> <start> why does she not come in ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.1878014202542313
<start> <start> <start> charlotte says , she hardly ever does . <end> <end> <end>
1.9863778547380273

2.0853645719501106
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and sir william , to elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way . <end> <end> <end>
1.6673149566566714
<start> <start> <start> at length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . <end> <end> <end>
2.2455325760658673
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> mr . collins ' s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete . <end> <end> <end>
1.9638547593406968
<start> <start> <start> the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of lady catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . <end> <end> <end>
1.774725755246771
<start> <start> <start> " i confess ," said he , " that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship ' s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings . <end> <end> <end>

2.109514492967821
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them . <end> <end> <end>
1.8447042201808757
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter . <end> <end> <end>
1.5695177867918624
<start> <start> <start> i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more . <end> <end> <end>

2.1959628348327667
<start> <start> <start> while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner .-- such formidable accounts of her ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened maria lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at st . james ' s . <end> <end> <end>
1.6978001201285973
<start> <start> <start> when they ascended the steps to the hall , maria ' s alarm was every moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly calm .-- elizabeth ' s courage did not fail her . <end> <end> <end>
1.7221946855105494
<start> <start> <start> she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> from the entrance hall , of which mr . collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti - chamber , to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and mrs . jenkinson were sitting .-- her ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as mrs . collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> in spite of having been at st . james ' s , sir william was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . <end> <end> <end>
1.865758663569697
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly .-- lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly - marked features , which might once have been handsome . <end> <end> <end>
1.5807482633989802
<start> <start> <start> her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . <end> <end> <end>
1.8414438244069775
<start> <start> <start> she was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self - importance , and brought mr . wickham immediately to elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented . <end> <end> <end>
1.8550758245563164
<start> <start> <start> when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr . darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small . <end> <end> <end>
1.8974946425219792
<start> <start> <start> there was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies . <end> <end> <end>
1.669214089919627
<start> <start> <start> miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to mrs . jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes . <end> <end> <end>
1.8191763327765211
<start> <start> <start> after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , mr . collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer . <end> <end> <end>
2.00449417523732
<start> <start> <start> the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which mr . collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater .-- he carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear . <end> <end> <end>
1.750185715565337
<start> <start> <start> but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them . <end> <end> <end>
1.6420070519191574
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time . <end> <end> <end>
1.93061594003885
<start> <start> <start> mrs . jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed . <end> <end> <end>
1.6058259261500407
<start> <start> <start> maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . <end> <end> <end>
2.334247870363262
<start> <start> <start> when the ladies returned to the drawing - room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted . <end> <end> <end>
1.8569910091879183
<start> <start> <start> she enquired into charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her ' s , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry . <end> <end> <end>
1.880522886523343
<start> <start> <start> in the intervals of her discourse with mrs . collins , she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to mrs . collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl . <end> <end> <end>
1.937071833871767
<start> <start> <start> she asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s maiden name ?-- elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly .-- lady catherine then observed , " your father ' s estate is entailed on mr . collins , i think . <end> <end> <end>
1.8197114655431406
<start> <start> <start> for your sake ," turning to charlotte , " i am glad of it ; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line .-- it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh ' s family .-- do you play and sing , miss bennet ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.9018410066854812
<start> <start> <start> " a little ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " has your governess left you ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.045791699730832

1.9602221477455701
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . <end> <end> <end>

2.0047970394925376
<start> <start> <start> " aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if i had known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . <end> <end> <end>
1.8399737647369896
<start> <start> <start> i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . <end> <end> <end>
1.6144374462313231
<start> <start> <start> it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " all !-- what , all five out at once ? <end> <end> <end>
1.7749565388742634
<start> <start> <start> very odd !-- and you only the second .-- the younger ones out before the elder are married !-- your younger sisters must be very young ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.6199174747499068
<start> <start> <start> " yes , my youngest is not sixteen . <end> <end> <end>
1.8912380947872098
<start> <start> <start> perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company . <end> <end> <end>
1.8682609817516576
<start> <start> <start> but really , ma ' am , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early .-- the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first . <end> <end> <end>
1.8030852499845265
<start> <start> <start> and to be kept back on _such_ a motive !-- i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7824476904673652
<start> <start> <start> " upon my word ," said her ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .-- pray , what is your age ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.903160890780164
<start> <start> <start> " with three younger sisters grown up ," replied elizabeth smiling , " your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it ." <end> <end> <end>
1.862916324221543
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . <end> <end> <end>
1.78102968399513
<start> <start> <start> " you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure ,-- therefore you need not conceal your age ." <end> <end> <end>
2.066693493801178
<start> <start> <start> when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed . <end> <end> <end>
1.9820138196386994
<start> <start> <start> their table was superlatively stupid . <end> <end> <end>
2.0794413384556245
<start> <start> <start> scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when mrs . jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light . <end> <end> <end>
1.6948164488208208
<start> <start> <start> a great deal more passed at the other table . <end> <end> <end>
2.345864924191702
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many . <end> <end> <end>
1.523170582766469
<start> <start> <start> sir william did not say much . <end> <end> <end>
2.277357676252566
<start> <start> <start> he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names . <end> <end> <end>
1.7143876267593534
<start> <start> <start> when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to mrs . collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . <end> <end> <end>
1.873755044775702
<start> <start> <start> the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow . <end> <end> <end>
1.7099080086123688
<start> <start> <start> as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . <end> <end> <end>
2.37235198151413
<start> <start> <start> chapter vii . <end> <end> <end>
2.2704477686791944
<start> <start> <start> while sir william was with them , mr . collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . <end> <end> <end>
1.7411444774802998
<start> <start> <start> the room in which the ladies sat was backwards . <end> <end> <end>
1.9807339856109976
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining - parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr . collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement . <end> <end> <end>
1.806701944317581
<start> <start> <start> from the drawing - room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr . collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day . <end> <end> <end>
1.920428369932078
<start> <start> <start> she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out . <end> <end> <end>
2.10055427358967
<start> <start> <start> very few days passed in which mr . collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . <end> <end> <end>
1.950457175916892
<start> <start> <start> now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits . <end> <end> <end>
2.065603532809178
<start> <start> <start> she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs . collins ' s joints of meat were too large for her family . <end> <end> <end>
1.6246697491720814
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr . collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty . <end> <end> <end>
1.5044276530579261
<start> <start> <start> the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first . <end> <end> <end>
1.8374332381889744
<start> <start> <start> their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the collinses ' reach . <end> <end> <end>
1.6857484573354105
<start> <start> <start> her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine ' s curiosity . <end> <end> <end>
1.857760867790483
<start> <start> <start> in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . <end> <end> <end>
1.856432102187369
<start> <start> <start> easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important . <end> <end> <end>
1.9666697653783904
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr . darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself . <end> <end> <end>
1.8413842349781806
<start> <start> <start> his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr . collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence . <end> <end> <end>
1.7996410505816833
<start> <start> <start> on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects . <end> <end> <end>
1.8586200852197803
<start> <start> <start> there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for mr . darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party , when mr . collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him . <end> <end> <end>
1.9895657613996078
<start> <start> <start> charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility . <end> <end> <end>
1.8597003234453018
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8241267019938145
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door - bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . <end> <end> <end>
1.5277385206492737
<start> <start> <start> colonel fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . <end> <end> <end>
1.6876528669709239
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to mrs . collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . <end> <end> <end>
1.9440762551032291
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word . <end> <end> <end>
2.1955819448579117
<start> <start> <start> colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well - bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs . collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body . <end> <end> <end>
1.7205559219271822
<start> <start> <start> have you never happened to see her there ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.3092059368121065
<start> <start> <start> she was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet . <end> <end> <end>
2.056237321078442
<start> <start> <start> the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter viii . <end> <end> <end>
2.2704477686791944
<start> <start> <start> for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter . <end> <end> <end>
1.8543553527768453
<start> <start> <start> colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but mr . darcy they had only seen at church . <end> <end> <end>
2.2224928431709
<start> <start> <start> the invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine ' s drawing - room . <end> <end> <end>
2.004593397296545
<start> <start> <start> her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room . <end> <end> <end>
1.8759138815551866
<start> <start> <start> colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings ; and mrs . collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much . <end> <end> <end>
1.7898725462933873
<start> <start> <start> he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr . darcy . <end> <end> <end>

2.253757320527831
<start> <start> <start> " we are speaking of music , madam ," said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . <end> <end> <end>
1.9476775122944199
<start> <start> <start> " of music ! <end> <end> <end>
2.424891366729509

1.923004497870385
<start> <start> <start> i must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . <end> <end> <end>
2.2345897872352567
<start> <start> <start> there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . <end> <end> <end>

1.9407920647939025
<start> <start> <start> " i am very glad to hear such a good account of her ," said lady catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0937005458899534
<start> <start> <start> " i assure you , madam ," he replied , " that she does not need such advice . <end> <end> <end>
2.418667887665693
<start> <start> <start> she practises very constantly ." <end> <end> <end>

1.9768989067206024
<start> <start> <start> it cannot be done too much ; and when i next write to her , i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . <end> <end> <end>
2.129563287253883
<start> <start> <start> i often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice . <end> <end> <end>
1.7826317593043708
<start> <start> <start> i have told miss bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though mrs . collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as i have often told her , to come to rosings every day , and play on the piano - forte in mrs . jenkinson ' s room . <end> <end> <end>
1.9962916348709718
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made no answer . <end> <end> <end>
2.1051847966884574
<start> <start> <start> when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument . <end> <end> <end>
2.0486620270279685
<start> <start> <start> he drew a chair near her . <end> <end> <end>
2.0493234566346943
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano - forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance . <end> <end> <end>
1.6997722956953432
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , " you mean to frighten me , mr . darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? <end> <end> <end>
2.0067807472659416
<start> <start> <start> but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well . <end> <end> <end>
1.967789793220311
<start> <start> <start> there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . <end> <end> <end>
1.7677639793689495
<start> <start> <start> my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8086467757010345
<start> <start> <start> " i shall not say that you are mistaken ," he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own ." <end> <end> <end>
2.003951751780372
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to colonel fitzwilliam , " your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word i say . <end> <end> <end>
2.049447631379628
<start> <start> <start> i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . <end> <end> <end>
1.849272462877272
<start> <start> <start> indeed , mr . darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7674124951266061
<start> <start> <start> " i am not afraid of you ," said he , smilingly . <end> <end> <end>
2.237281024872507
<start> <start> <start> " pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of ," cried colonel fitzwilliam . <end> <end> <end>
1.8373292398355567
<start> <start> <start> " i should like to know how he behaves among strangers ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> i am sorry to pain you -- but so it was . <end> <end> <end>
1.9868931604753057
<start> <start> <start> he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . <end> <end> <end>
1.6698470178603824
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy , you cannot deny the fact ." <end> <end> <end>

2.106636578193449
<start> <start> <start> " perhaps ," said darcy , " i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers ." <end> <end> <end>
2.041248493504401
<start> <start> <start> " shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.9012688873162509
<start> <start> <start> said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam . <end> <end> <end>
2.3864298503343164
<start> <start> <start> " shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.8733977271337774
<start> <start> <start> it is because he will not give himself the trouble ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9376063999652304
<start> <start> <start> " i certainly have not the talent which some people possess ," said darcy , " of conversing easily with those i have never seen before . <end> <end> <end>
1.7991169682277297
<start> <start> <start> i cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7812152274960915
<start> <start> <start> " my fingers ," said elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women ' s do . <end> <end> <end>
1.7055715941427825
<start> <start> <start> no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting . <end> <end> <end>
1.7416907521995453
<start> <start> <start> we neither of us perform to strangers ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9524789107038976
<start> <start> <start> here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . <end> <end> <end>
2.2943522066495463
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth immediately began playing again . <end> <end> <end>
2.0920056159720946
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to darcy , " miss bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master . <end> <end> <end>
2.237910253656771
<start> <start> <start> she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne ' s . <end> <end> <end>
1.7868857656601143
<start> <start> <start> anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn ." <end> <end> <end>
2.11469836745087
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_ , had she been his relation . <end> <end> <end>
1.9684097877272426
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth ' s performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste . <end> <end> <end>
1.6724091887279025
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter ix . <end> <end> <end>
2.2704477686791944
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while mrs . collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . <end> <end> <end>
1.9204355132683995
<start> <start> <start> he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . <end> <end> <end>
1.732877410419245
<start> <start> <start> they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . <end> <end> <end>
1.8432515244740848
<start> <start> <start> it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr . darcy ! <end> <end> <end>
2.043026617880713
<start> <start> <start> it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr . bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before . <end> <end> <end>
2.2308036488820835
<start> <start> <start> he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london ." <end> <end> <end>
2.698641829429208
<start> <start> <start> " perfectly so -- i thank you ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2359766854075835
<start> <start> <start> she found that she was to receive no other answer -- and , after a short pause , added , " i think i have understood that mr . bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.3422748767904915
<start> <start> <start> " i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . <end> <end> <end>
1.9801176605775848
<start> <start> <start> he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9197086694291399
<start> <start> <start> " if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . <end> <end> <end>
1.7693452578497475
<start> <start> <start> but perhaps mr . bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8699768699051038
<start> <start> <start> " i should not be surprised ," said darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3099769927083025
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth made no answer . <end> <end> <end>
2.0381294614960908
<start> <start> <start> she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . <end> <end> <end>
2.187950034045627
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr . collins first came to hunsford ." <end> <end> <end>
2.479149109969706
<start> <start> <start> " i believe she did -- and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object ." <end> <end> <end>
2.14375857525286
<start> <start> <start> " mr . collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife ." <end> <end> <end>
2.135551369444542
<start> <start> <start> " yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . <end> <end> <end>
1.6659274446660488
<start> <start> <start> my friend has an excellent understanding -- though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr . collins as the wisest thing she ever did . <end> <end> <end>
1.9703225102794144
<start> <start> <start> she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2597742028982735
<start> <start> <start> " it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0267535322099146
<start> <start> <start> " an easy distance do you call it ? <end> <end> <end>
1.8737698997870158
<start> <start> <start> it is nearly fifty miles ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1080244556492604
<start> <start> <start> " and what is fifty miles of good road ? <end> <end> <end>
1.8801339134700084
<start> <start> <start> little more than half a day ' s journey . <end> <end> <end>
2.303678140334852
<start> <start> <start> " i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match ," cried elizabeth . <end> <end> <end>
1.9538179004189409
<start> <start> <start> " i should never have said mrs . collins was settled _near_ her family ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5191556177407475
<start> <start> <start> " it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire . <end> <end> <end>
2.1462692323039105
<start> <start> <start> any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9275419412138637
<start> <start> <start> as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . <end> <end> <end>
2.1382874736419484
<start> <start> <start> where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil . <end> <end> <end>
1.6719119209473132
<start> <start> <start> _you_ cannot have been always at longbourn ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1102133455509833
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth looked surprised . <end> <end> <end>
2.390679079828346
<start> <start> <start> the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , " are you pleased with kent ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.8480524842587442
<start> <start> <start> a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise -- and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk . <end> <end> <end>
1.8591881635702656
<start> <start> <start> the tête - à - tête surprised them . <end> <end> <end>
1.8879144181339
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away . <end> <end> <end>
2.0626476433129057
<start> <start> <start> " what can be the meaning of this !" <end> <end> <end>
1.9845369609232313
<start> <start> <start> said charlotte , as soon as he was gone . <end> <end> <end>
2.755014406493488
<start> <start> <start> " my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way ." <end> <end> <end>
2.116288716802063
<start> <start> <start> all field sports were over . <end> <end> <end>
2.1040433925985704
<start> <start> <start> within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day . <end> <end> <end>
1.8188273211942145
<start> <start> <start> they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt . <end> <end> <end>
1.7683262555146706
<start> <start> <start> it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . <end> <end> <end>
1.8557915039393826
<start> <start> <start> but why mr . darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand . <end> <end> <end>
2.5019316566025216
<start> <start> <start> it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice -- a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself . <end> <end> <end>
1.7322815378384422
<start> <start> <start> he seldom appeared really animated . <end> <end> <end>
2.1003189165491016
<start> <start> <start> mrs . collins knew not what to make of him . <end> <end> <end>
2.2265255717648937
<start> <start> <start> colonel fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out .-- she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success . <end> <end> <end>
1.8813966210048383
<start> <start> <start> it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind . <end> <end> <end>
1.8110804771437365
<start> <start> <start> in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam . <end> <end> <end>
1.7081397566978989
<start> <start> <start> he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr . darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . <end> <end> <end>
1.9914459001584286
<start> <start> <start> chapter x . more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr . <end> <end> <end>
1.8002226593898019
<start> <start> <start> darcy .-- she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .-- how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd !-- yet it did , and even a third . <end> <end> <end>
1.6721417736964272
<start> <start> <start> it seemed like wilful ill - nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . <end> <end> <end>
1.6324002637611679
<start> <start> <start> he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr . and mrs . collins ' s happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too . <end> <end> <end>
1.8518789265230682
<start> <start> <start> his words seemed to imply it . <end> <end> <end>
2.0209906717363353
<start> <start> <start> could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? <end> <end> <end>
1.8928752133035445
<start> <start> <start> she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter . <end> <end> <end>
1.9550083635435898
<start> <start> <start> it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage . <end> <end> <end>
2.0771027960939246
<start> <start> <start> she was engaged one day as she walked , in re - perusing jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr . darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her . <end> <end> <end>
1.8247132250692053
<start> <start> <start> putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , " i did not know before that you ever walked this way ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " i am thinking of what you have been telling me ," said she . <end> <end> <end>

2.097120812082576
<start> <start> <start> " that is not an unnatural surmise ," said fitzwilliam , " but it is lessening the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly ." <end> <end> <end>
2.075693305647353
<start> <start> <start> this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr . darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage . <end> <end> <end>
2.1500810899635536

2.390901472797848
<start> <start> <start> it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected . <end> <end> <end>
1.6622131311727413
<start> <start> <start> that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr . bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . <end> <end> <end>
2.323715313819332
<start> <start> <start> if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , _he_ was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . <end> <end> <end>
1.8966064781801262
<start> <start> <start> " there were some very strong objections against the lady ," were colonel fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london . <end> <end> <end>
1.447773963808419
<start> <start> <start> " to jane herself ," she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection . <end> <end> <end>
1.8982536340373524
<start> <start> <start> her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . <end> <end> <end>
2.08654448715516
<start> <start> <start> the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr . darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . <end> <end> <end>
1.6591271545193338
<start> <start> <start> when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr . darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent . <end> <end> <end>
1.9864705280022898
<start> <start> <start> they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . <end> <end> <end>
1.6590234544440323
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . <end> <end> <end>
1.8206895960946905
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister ' s sufferings . <end> <end> <end>
2.060686804672162
<start> <start> <start> it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . <end> <end> <end>
1.6857330418797094
<start> <start> <start> she could not think of darcy ' s leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him . <end> <end> <end>
2.138725809024996
<start> <start> <start> but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr . darcy walk into the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.083395492941439
<start> <start> <start> in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . <end> <end> <end>
1.6461961020690363
<start> <start> <start> she answered him with cold civility . <end> <end> <end>
2.1368174867431433
<start> <start> <start> he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.1170882586060245
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word . <end> <end> <end>
2.0691351649261436
<start> <start> <start> after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " in vain have i struggled . <end> <end> <end>
1.6710759608309618
<start> <start> <start> it will not do . <end> <end> <end>
2.860060051550398
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression . <end> <end> <end>
2.2911480375466735
<start> <start> <start> she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . <end> <end> <end>
2.1546396797694354
<start> <start> <start> this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed . <end> <end> <end>
2.206973816051355
<start> <start> <start> he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . <end> <end> <end>
2.0238604741352697
<start> <start> <start> his sense of her inferiority -- of its being a degradation -- of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit . <end> <end> <end>
1.519539384296998
<start> <start> <start> in spite of her deeply - rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger . <end> <end> <end>
1.8506753898132287
<start> <start> <start> she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . <end> <end> <end>
2.1543177554036115
<start> <start> <start> he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . <end> <end> <end>
1.9208138893692845
<start> <start> <start> as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . <end> <end> <end>
2.344760061634515
<start> <start> <start> he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security . <end> <end> <end>
1.8397364478616751
<start> <start> <start> such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . <end> <end> <end>
1.942038649993738
<start> <start> <start> it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could _feel_ gratitude , i would now thank you . <end> <end> <end>
1.987450104881025
<start> <start> <start> but i cannot -- i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . <end> <end> <end>
1.950223648498063
<start> <start> <start> i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one . <end> <end> <end>
2.0250661917438535
<start> <start> <start> it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration . <end> <end> <end>
2.3644495332720843
<start> <start> <start> the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation ." <end> <end> <end>
1.649625548274959
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy , who was leaning against the mantle - piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise . <end> <end> <end>
1.8038846940165374
<start> <start> <start> he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it . <end> <end> <end>
1.8326444220097227
<start> <start> <start> i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _endeavour_ at civility , i am thus rejected . <end> <end> <end>
2.0273635811572213
<start> <start> <start> " i might as well enquire ," replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? <end> <end> <end>
1.5969142585906648
<start> <start> <start> but i have other provocations . <end> <end> <end>

2.2624608203346157
<start> <start> <start> had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.801275425397751
<start> <start> <start> " i have every reason in the world to think ill of you . <end> <end> <end>
2.180248446846448
<start> <start> <start> no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_ . <end> <end> <end>
1.6377371360372166
<start> <start> <start> you dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7065253436398116
<start> <start> <start> she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse . <end> <end> <end>
1.7670837367556171
<start> <start> <start> he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . <end> <end> <end>
2.2426520594429316
<start> <start> <start> " can you deny that you have done it ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.2629233042728587
<start> <start> <start> with assumed tranquillity he then replied , " i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success . <end> <end> <end>
2.0475425426398575
<start> <start> <start> towards _him_ i have been kinder than towards myself ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2068711940983374
<start> <start> <start> " but it is not merely this affair ," she continued , " on which my dislike is founded . <end> <end> <end>
1.8782860527626049
<start> <start> <start> long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . <end> <end> <end>
1.9523492310872232
<start> <start> <start> your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr . wickham . <end> <end> <end>
1.9568053216385115
<start> <start> <start> in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? <end> <end> <end>
1.7772251544077375
<start> <start> <start> or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.8448597477757334
<start> <start> <start> " you take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns ," said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . <end> <end> <end>
1.8643068889912466
<start> <start> <start> " who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.6484831962664883
<start> <start> <start> " his misfortunes !" <end> <end> <end>
2.4133618990771972
<start> <start> <start> repeated darcy contemptuously ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed ." <end> <end> <end>
2.015286792099519
<start> <start> <start> " you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty . <end> <end> <end>
1.6136323713063703
<start> <start> <start> you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him . <end> <end> <end>
1.9181836373990475
<start> <start> <start> you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert . <end> <end> <end>
1.5819620474490885
<start> <start> <start> you have done all this ! <end> <end> <end>
2.473918612910998
<start> <start> <start> and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7259669562045248
<start> <start> <start> " and this ," cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me ! <end> <end> <end>
2.3097026108700387
<start> <start> <start> this is the estimation in which you hold me ! <end> <end> <end>

1.9348491561984347
<start> <start> <start> my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed ! <end> <end> <end>
1.882850675174316
<start> <start> <start> but perhaps ," added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . <end> <end> <end>
1.5801383420774433
<start> <start> <start> but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . <end> <end> <end>
1.884416756890706
<start> <start> <start> nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related . <end> <end> <end>
1.8747826511021526
<start> <start> <start> could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? <end> <end> <end>
1.8947189553125516
<start> <start> <start> to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.7285723062797245
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " you are mistaken , mr . darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8043648412313331
<start> <start> <start> she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1995238669921062
<start> <start> <start> again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification . <end> <end> <end>
1.9514182598648646
<start> <start> <start> she went on . <end> <end> <end>

1.8986976365178876
<start> <start> <start> i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . <end> <end> <end>
1.8180660812726577
<start> <start> <start> forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8041929087036426
<start> <start> <start> and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . <end> <end> <end>
1.8383678132509373
<start> <start> <start> the tumult of her mind was now painfully great . <end> <end> <end>
2.1067629378974613
<start> <start> <start> she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour . <end> <end> <end>
1.945011323578926
<start> <start> <start> her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> that he should have been in love with her for so many months ! <end> <end> <end>
2.837007435648691
<start> <start> <start> so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! <end> <end> <end>
2.055288446799734
<start> <start> <start> it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection . <end> <end> <end>
1.8247392646760616
<start> <start> <start> but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr . wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . <end> <end> <end>
1.9316484974854338
<start> <start> <start> she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room . <end> <end> <end>

2.2704477686791944
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes . <end> <end> <end>
1.7837541287269099
<start> <start> <start> she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . <end> <end> <end>
1.8113571459730948
<start> <start> <start> she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr . darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road . <end> <end> <end>
1.9764715588454145
<start> <start> <start> the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground . <end> <end> <end>
2.139005484501727
<start> <start> <start> after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park . <end> <end> <end>
2.0113334848936737
<start> <start> <start> the five weeks which she had now passed in kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees . <end> <end> <end>
1.901959559764588
<start> <start> <start> she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being mr . darcy , she was directly retreating . <end> <end> <end>
1.9151971107923276
<start> <start> <start> but the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name . <end> <end> <end>
2.1708059617761473
<start> <start> <start> she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr . darcy , she moved again towards the gate . <end> <end> <end>
2.015251579767844
<start> <start> <start> he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . <end> <end> <end>
1.8126264038560767
<start> <start> <start> will you do me the honour of reading that letter ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.099389171032641
<start> <start> <start> -- and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight . <end> <end> <end>
2.2163827444234254
<start> <start> <start> it was dated from rosings , at eight o ' clock in the morning , and was as follows :-- " be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you . <end> <end> <end>
1.6806364661764095
<start> <start> <start> i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . <end> <end> <end>
1.9645676640176413
<start> <start> <start> you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice . <end> <end> <end>
1.798562820287409
<start> <start> <start> " two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge . <end> <end> <end>
1.853448884259952
<start> <start> <start> the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr . bingley from your sister ,-- and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of mr . <end> <end> <end>
1.8318681014908278
<start> <start> <start> wickham .-- wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .-- but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .-- if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your ' s , i can only say that i am sorry .-- the necessity must be obeyed -- and farther apology would be absurd .-- i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country .-- but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment .-- i had often seen him in love before .-- at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas ' s accidental information , that bingley ' s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . <end> <end> <end>
1.6743528480423642
<start> <start> <start> he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided . <end> <end> <end>
1.9931269182183806
<start> <start> <start> from that moment i observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively ; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him . <end> <end> <end>
1.8665169150431526
<start> <start> <start> your sister i also watched .-- her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening ' s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .-- if _you_ have not been mistaken here , _i_ must have been in an error . <end> <end> <end>
1.6108711115374568
<start> <start> <start> your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .-- if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . <end> <end> <end>
1.7888758020081599
<start> <start> <start> but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .-- that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain ,-- but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .-- i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ;-- i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason .-- my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .-- but there were other causes of repugnance ;-- causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .-- these causes must be stated , though briefly .-- the situation of your mother ' s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father .-- pardon me .-- it pains me to offend you . <end> <end> <end>
1.4933269121312618
<start> <start> <start> but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .-- i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection .-- he left netherfield for london , on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .-- the part which i acted , is now to be explained .-- his sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london .-- we accordingly went -- and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .-- i described , and enforced them earnestly .-- but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference . <end> <end> <end>
1.4870321660237533
<start> <start> <start> he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .-- but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .-- to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . <end> <end> <end>
1.7128509131705714
<start> <start> <start> to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment .-- i cannot blame myself for having done thus much . <end> <end> <end>
1.5800703264573377
<start> <start> <start> there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ' s being in town . <end> <end> <end>
1.8217505115683976
<start> <start> <start> i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .-- that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ;-- but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .-- perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .-- it is done , however , and it was done for the best .-- on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . <end> <end> <end>
1.8062301739249058
<start> <start> <start> if i have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them .-- with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr . wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . <end> <end> <end>
1.7981848088974195
<start> <start> <start> of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity . <end> <end> <end>
1.8352701851858784
<start> <start> <start> mr . wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god - son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . <end> <end> <end>
1.979092444206594
<start> <start> <start> my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ;-- most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education . <end> <end> <end>
1.851958636755721
<start> <start> <start> my father was not only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . <end> <end> <end>
1.7599006365452547
<start> <start> <start> as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner . <end> <end> <end>
2.165257952597622
<start> <start> <start> the vicious propensities -- the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr . darcy could not have . <end> <end> <end>
1.878732633581209
<start> <start> <start> here again i shall give you pain -- to what degree you only can tell . <end> <end> <end>
1.734761151712388
<start> <start> <start> but whatever may be the sentiments which mr . wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character . <end> <end> <end>
1.8871584616974857
<start> <start> <start> it adds even another motive . <end> <end> <end>
2.110414253389889
<start> <start> <start> my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr . wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant . <end> <end> <end>
1.7800069392097668
<start> <start> <start> there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds . <end> <end> <end>
1.892581297211444
<start> <start> <start> his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr . wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . <end> <end> <end>
1.6984880695539466
<start> <start> <start> he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein . <end> <end> <end>
2.0090169511352753
<start> <start> <start> i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal . <end> <end> <end>
1.817366597603345
<start> <start> <start> the business was therefore soon settled . <end> <end> <end>
2.041520026183682
<start> <start> <start> he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . <end> <end> <end>
1.795475179099068
<start> <start> <start> all connection between us seemed now dissolved . <end> <end> <end>
1.9265423322687152
<start> <start> <start> in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation . <end> <end> <end>
1.5023585822511216
<start> <start> <start> for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . <end> <end> <end>
1.8118727584777194
<start> <start> <start> his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . <end> <end> <end>
2.1809665944215193
<start> <start> <start> you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it . <end> <end> <end>
1.6079843452050193
<start> <start> <start> his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself . <end> <end> <end>
1.5918265325183851
<start> <start> <start> after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt . <end> <end> <end>
1.848568622808525
<start> <start> <start> i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . <end> <end> <end>
1.5773219445987245
<start> <start> <start> having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy . <end> <end> <end>
2.1055808954407067
<start> <start> <start> about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr . wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs . younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . <end> <end> <end>
1.6506328880682424
<start> <start> <start> she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself . <end> <end> <end>
1.9680120600864661
<start> <start> <start> i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . <end> <end> <end>
1.6031069051868498
<start> <start> <start> you may imagine what i felt and how i acted . <end> <end> <end>
1.958851207249204
<start> <start> <start> regard for my sister ' s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr . wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs . younge was of course removed from her charge . <end> <end> <end>
2.1098947362891
<start> <start> <start> mr . wickham ' s chief object was unquestionably my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement . <end> <end> <end>
2.074192426142128
<start> <start> <start> his revenge would have been complete indeed . <end> <end> <end>
2.4198066360847172
<start> <start> <start> this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr . wickham . <end> <end> <end>
2.0214071956568715
<start> <start> <start> i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . <end> <end> <end>
1.6550952506842114
<start> <start> <start> ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . <end> <end> <end>
1.8040060309609727
<start> <start> <start> you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . <end> <end> <end>
1.9618475287757962
<start> <start> <start> but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . <end> <end> <end>
1.9738054718233007
<start> <start> <start> for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father ' s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions . <end> <end> <end>
1.7341321047541722
<start> <start> <start> if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . <end> <end> <end>
1.8329085560809446
<start> <start> <start> i will only add , god bless you . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> if elizabeth , when mr . darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . <end> <end> <end>
2.265928880834208
<start> <start> <start> but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited . <end> <end> <end>
1.9988744063838382
<start> <start> <start> with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . <end> <end> <end>
1.6367512924595746
<start> <start> <start> with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield . <end> <end> <end>
1.8059195570270958
<start> <start> <start> she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . <end> <end> <end>
1.58090630749987
<start> <start> <start> his belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . <end> <end> <end>
1.8648679998823408
<start> <start> <start> he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty . <end> <end> <end>
1.7381222453912972
<start> <start> <start> but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr . wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition . <end> <end> <end>
1.6105318668916215
<start> <start> <start> astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her . <end> <end> <end>
2.0562617498126645
<start> <start> <start> she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " this must be false ! <end> <end> <end>
1.9854747758622366
<start> <start> <start> this cannot be ! <end> <end> <end>
2.403431937771961
<start> <start> <start> this must be the grossest falsehood !" <end> <end> <end>
2.355382575711006
<start> <start> <start> -- and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . <end> <end> <end>
1.7732866556342264
<start> <start> <start> so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great . <end> <end> <end>
1.7590826850032502
<start> <start> <start> what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . <end> <end> <end>
1.9568997076491683
<start> <start> <start> she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality -- deliberated on the probability of each statement -- but with little success . <end> <end> <end>
1.6323607150539214
<start> <start> <start> on both sides it was only assertion . <end> <end> <end>
2.318780932427402
<start> <start> <start> again she read on . <end> <end> <end>
2.3162304570516903
<start> <start> <start> but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr . darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole . <end> <end> <end>
1.7426375226382103
<start> <start> <start> the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr . wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . <end> <end> <end>
1.7839283144799125
<start> <start> <start> she had never heard of him before his entrance into the ---- shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . <end> <end> <end>
1.8968643118808108
<start> <start> <start> of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself . <end> <end> <end>
1.6546935791427189
<start> <start> <start> his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue . <end> <end> <end>
1.6954788211994778
<start> <start> <start> she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess . <end> <end> <end>
1.895718716969448
<start> <start> <start> after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . <end> <end> <end>
1.742569270621398
<start> <start> <start> but , alas ! <end> <end> <end>
2.34058751389607
<start> <start> <start> the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself -- from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question . <end> <end> <end>
1.633577701803626
<start> <start> <start> at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr . darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s corroboration . <end> <end> <end>
1.9917907639034267
<start> <start> <start> she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr . philips ' s . <end> <end> <end>
1.837516199409983
<start> <start> <start> many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . <end> <end> <end>
1.8646321057145103
<start> <start> <start> she was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . <end> <end> <end>
1.7058159525330905
<start> <start> <start> she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . <end> <end> <end>
2.096813910821274
<start> <start> <start> she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr . darcy -- that mr . darcy might leave the country , but that _he_ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week . <end> <end> <end>
2.0768640895522577
<start> <start> <start> she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr . darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son . <end> <end> <end>
1.7858608408381025
<start> <start> <start> his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing . <end> <end> <end>
1.6502982584412802
<start> <start> <start> that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued -- that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling . <end> <end> <end>
1.6692171295940712
<start> <start> <start> that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr . bingley , was incomprehensible . <end> <end> <end>
1.9089097870342207
<start> <start> <start> she grew absolutely ashamed of herself .-- of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd . <end> <end> <end>
1.6380300688633944
<start> <start> <start> " how despicably have i acted !" <end> <end> <end>
2.0111325870338734
<start> <start> <start> who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust .-- how humiliating is this discovery !-- yet , how just a humiliation !-- had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind . <end> <end> <end>
1.6141435910182549
<start> <start> <start> but vanity , not love , has been my folly .-- pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned . <end> <end> <end>
1.7342299719670202
<start> <start> <start> till this moment , i never knew myself ." <end> <end> <end>
2.341207995348073
<start> <start> <start> from herself to jane -- from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr . darcy ' s explanation _there_ , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . <end> <end> <end>
1.8596233353545164
<start> <start> <start> widely different was the effect of a second perusal .-- how could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ?-- he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister ' s attachment ;-- and she could not help remembering what charlotte ' s opinion had always been .-- neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane .-- she felt that jane ' s feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . <end> <end> <end>
1.7689045743960905
<start> <start> <start> when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe . <end> <end> <end>
1.8348124908085393
<start> <start> <start> the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers . <end> <end> <end>
1.7860287634655783
<start> <start> <start> it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self - attracted by the rest of her family ;-- and as she considered that jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before . <end> <end> <end>
1.7804311944575604
<start> <start> <start> after wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re - considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . <end> <end> <end>
1.6550742288445695
<start> <start> <start> she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence ; mr . darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found .-- elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it . <end> <end> <end>
1.7426469196147585
<start> <start> <start> colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object . <end> <end> <end>
2.336851289598093
<start> <start> <start> she could think only of her letter . <end> <end> <end>
2.0807651273180463
<start> <start> <start> chapter xiv . <end> <end> <end>
2.2704477686791944
<start> <start> <start> the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ; and mr . collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings . <end> <end> <end>
1.7483011192916125
<start> <start> <start> to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her . <end> <end> <end>
1.8940863492172362
<start> <start> <start> " what would she have said ?-- how would she have behaved ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.8075445268071724
<start> <start> <start> their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party .--" i assure you , i feel it exceedingly ," said lady catherine ; " i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do . <end> <end> <end>
1.970039306783754
<start> <start> <start> but i am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me !-- they were excessively sorry to go ! <end> <end> <end>
1.8989914122243876
<start> <start> <start> but so they always are . <end> <end> <end>
2.16251424494466
<start> <start> <start> the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more i think than last year . <end> <end> <end>
1.497578325022459
<start> <start> <start> his attachment to rosings , certainly increases ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2927905502058934
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " but if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . <end> <end> <end>
2.054258911722656
<start> <start> <start> mrs . collins will be very glad of your company , i am sure ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3875599570496404
<start> <start> <start> " why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . <end> <end> <end>
1.8879645286000295
<start> <start> <start> i expected you to stay two months . <end> <end> <end>
2.037861776244223
<start> <start> <start> i told mrs . collins so before you came . <end> <end> <end>
2.258704718246197
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9059016332094296
<start> <start> <start> your father of course may spare you , if your mother can .-- daughters are never of so much consequence to a father . <end> <end> <end>
1.5418943533062237
<start> <start> <start> and if you will stay another _month_ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london , for i am going there early in june , for a week ; and as dawson does not object to the barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , i should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9635280898774436
<start> <start> <start> " you are all kindness , madam ; but i believe we must abide by our original plan ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8989214808952881
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine seemed resigned . <end> <end> <end>
2.244728241629346
<start> <start> <start> " mrs . collins , you must send a servant with them . <end> <end> <end>
2.672648699730298
<start> <start> <start> you know i always speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . <end> <end> <end>
1.9947210909181068
<start> <start> <start> it is highly improper . <end> <end> <end>
2.220666439420255
<start> <start> <start> when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men servants go with her .-- miss darcy , the daughter of mr . darcy , of pemberley , and lady anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner .-- i am excessively attentive to all those things . <end> <end> <end>
1.8126016218356091
<start> <start> <start> " my uncle is to send a servant for us ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9748382597339176
<start> <start> <start> " oh !-- your uncle !-- he keeps a man - servant , does he ?-- i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . <end> <end> <end>
1.5075594645492514
<start> <start> <start> where shall you change horses ?-- oh ! <end> <end> <end>
1.9156247394792167
<start> <start> <start> reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . <end> <end> <end>
1.5652042993918582
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . <end> <end> <end>
2.1780768000764597
<start> <start> <start> she studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different . <end> <end> <end>
1.6990220307622539
<start> <start> <start> when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . <end> <end> <end>
1.7097335369150566
<start> <start> <start> in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin . <end> <end> <end>
1.877810834476177
<start> <start> <start> they were hopeless of remedy . <end> <end> <end>
2.0964324038430013
<start> <start> <start> they were ignorant , idle , and vain . <end> <end> <end>
1.9497333004064021
<start> <start> <start> while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there for ever . <end> <end> <end>
1.9272038207567437
<start> <start> <start> anxiety on jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and mr . darcy ' s explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost . <end> <end> <end>
1.9333680808272662
<start> <start> <start> his affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend . <end> <end> <end>
1.6422145264316255
<start> <start> <start> how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family ! <end> <end> <end>
1.65718216359082
<start> <start> <start> when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . <end> <end> <end>
1.6314711926921055
<start> <start> <start> their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first . <end> <end> <end>
2.0092867391121048
<start> <start> <start> the very last evening was spent there ; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh . <end> <end> <end>
1.7275077729138675
<start> <start> <start> on saturday morning elizabeth and mr . collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary . <end> <end> <end>
1.948720253401625
<start> <start> <start> " i know not , miss elizabeth ," said he , " whether mrs . collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . <end> <end> <end>
2.0998800321029902
<start> <start> <start> we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode . <end> <end> <end>
1.7047170806152956
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . <end> <end> <end>
1.7887344788497883
<start> <start> <start> she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make _her_ feel the obliged . <end> <end> <end>
1.9782667909686409
<start> <start> <start> mr . collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . <end> <end> <end>
2.09325247223571
<start> <start> <start> we have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome . <end> <end> <end>
1.4735020794889928
<start> <start> <start> our situation with regard to lady catherine ' s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . <end> <end> <end>
1.9789647053711465
<start> <start> <start> you see how continually we are engaged there . <end> <end> <end>
1.9110494447597475
<start> <start> <start> in truth i must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings ." <end> <end> <end>
1.729555383015304
<start> <start> <start> words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences . <end> <end> <end>
2.0151472338480216
<start> <start> <start> " you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire , my dear cousin . <end> <end> <end>

2.733662231488259
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine ' s great attentions to mrs . collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate -- but on this point it will be as well to be silent . <end> <end> <end>
1.9310148205503297
<start> <start> <start> only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . <end> <end> <end>
2.085687534627575

1.8739927053601089

2.363090045205806
<start> <start> <start> poor charlotte !-- it was melancholy to leave her to such society !-- but she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . <end> <end> <end>
1.8344546846805392
<start> <start> <start> her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms . <end> <end> <end>
1.7911232528504675
<start> <start> <start> at length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . <end> <end> <end>
1.664673081041409
<start> <start> <start> after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr . collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to mr . and mrs . gardiner , though unknown . <end> <end> <end>
2.053439549752577
<start> <start> <start> he then handed her in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings . <end> <end> <end>
1.8065179743420792

1.7731218540705869
<start> <start> <start> their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford , they reached mr . gardiner ' s house , where they were to remain a few days . <end> <end> <end>

2.085283164872462
<start> <start> <start> to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> kitty and me were to spend the day there , and mrs . forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by the bye , mrs . forster and me are _such_ friends !) <end> <end> <end>
2.091310171205928

1.882511078330465

1.9012446465402288
<start> <start> <start> with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did lydia , assisted by kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn . <end> <end> <end>
1.5529956618972376
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham ' s name . <end> <end> <end>
2.3612649166567654
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did mr . bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth , " i am glad you are come back , lizzy ." <end> <end> <end>
2.13034585453093
<start> <start> <start> their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; mrs . bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger miss lucases ; and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her . <end> <end> <end>
1.786103085565349
<start> <start> <start> mary ," said she , " i wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! <end> <end> <end>
2.415811271219306
<start> <start> <start> as we went along , kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . <end> <end> <end>
1.7898092453607064
<start> <start> <start> and then when we came away it was such fun ! <end> <end> <end>
2.057648962242314
<start> <start> <start> i thought we never should have got into the coach . <end> <end> <end>
1.801441535657703
<start> <start> <start> i was ready to die of laughter . <end> <end> <end>
2.1274972427591763
<start> <start> <start> and then we were so merry all the way home ! <end> <end> <end>
2.1192483033031038
<start> <start> <start> we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off !" <end> <end> <end>
1.6321723145677232
<start> <start> <start> to this , mary very gravely replied , " far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures . <end> <end> <end>
1.9485574887261279
<start> <start> <start> they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds . <end> <end> <end>
1.765257624375098
<start> <start> <start> but i confess they would have no charms for _me_ . <end> <end> <end>
1.9523510715998995
<start> <start> <start> she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all . <end> <end> <end>
1.9310039897593112
<start> <start> <start> in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on ; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . <end> <end> <end>
1.7755329938725517
<start> <start> <start> it should not be said , that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . <end> <end> <end>
2.6582982483416155
<start> <start> <start> there was another reason too for her opposition . <end> <end> <end>
1.9568276062249037
<start> <start> <start> she dreaded seeing wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . <end> <end> <end>
2.2356088431017387
<start> <start> <start> the comfort to _her_ , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . <end> <end> <end>
1.9210283211441401
<start> <start> <start> in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account . <end> <end> <end>
1.8723396994074162
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter xvii . <end> <end> <end>
2.2704477686791944
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr . darcy and herself . <end> <end> <end>
1.9905271471359152
<start> <start> <start> miss bennet ' s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . <end> <end> <end>
1.6295111006021246
<start> <start> <start> she was sorry that mr . darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him . <end> <end> <end>
1.8241116061844163
<start> <start> <start> " his being so sure of succeeding , was wrong ," said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7226422100323444
<start> <start> <start> " indeed ," replied elizabeth , " i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . <end> <end> <end>
2.057894480583012
<start> <start> <start> you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.4710190389732967
<start> <start> <start> " blame you ! <end> <end> <end>
2.4238714825031527

2.6088496138464583

<start> <start> <start> " no -- i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2469360416928525
<start> <start> <start> " but you _will_ know it , when i have told you what happened the very next day ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0496907641234032
<start> <start> <start> she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham . <end> <end> <end>
2.132482674045112
<start> <start> <start> what a stroke was this for poor jane ! <end> <end> <end>
1.8245069874691993
<start> <start> <start> who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual . <end> <end> <end>
1.5820742133532082
<start> <start> <start> nor was darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . <end> <end> <end>
1.9296416251964326
<start> <start> <start> most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other . <end> <end> <end>
1.6306215575697578
<start> <start> <start> " this will not do ," said elizabeth . <end> <end> <end>
2.4699803169927117
<start> <start> <start> take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . <end> <end> <end>
2.3621979859466884
<start> <start> <start> there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much . <end> <end> <end>
1.6925299776654612
<start> <start> <start> it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane . <end> <end> <end>

2.065307531511836
<start> <start> <start> i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham ' s character ." <end> <end> <end>
2.062257693020859
<start> <start> <start> miss bennet paused a little and then replied , " surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . <end> <end> <end>
1.8229133366324979
<start> <start> <start> what is your own opinion ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.4171723773459033
<start> <start> <start> " that it ought not to be attempted . <end> <end> <end>
2.582037932180275
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . <end> <end> <end>
1.9364905242580157
<start> <start> <start> on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? <end> <end> <end>
2.0533460386308993
<start> <start> <start> the general prejudice against mr . darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . <end> <end> <end>
2.0227732928772086
<start> <start> <start> i am not equal to it . <end> <end> <end>
2.418931372322414
<start> <start> <start> wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is . <end> <end> <end>
1.8341368453433289
<start> <start> <start> sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . <end> <end> <end>
1.896953219664314
<start> <start> <start> at present i will say nothing about it ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " you are quite right . <end> <end> <end>
2.2371681452658327
<start> <start> <start> to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . <end> <end> <end>
1.8125942329807994
<start> <start> <start> we must not make him desperate ." <end> <end> <end>
2.167991224957171
<start> <start> <start> the tumult of elizabeth ' s mind was allayed by this conversation . <end> <end> <end>
1.9888667866538763
<start> <start> <start> she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . <end> <end> <end>
1.642504676974207
<start> <start> <start> but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure . <end> <end> <end>
1.9619246518819795
<start> <start> <start> she dared not relate the other half of mr . darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend . <end> <end> <end>
2.111871681298683
<start> <start> <start> here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery . <end> <end> <end>
1.6087038918551915
<start> <start> <start> " and then ," said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . <end> <end> <end>
1.8135449964645889
<start> <start> <start> she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits . <end> <end> <end>
2.0561974146472624
<start> <start> <start> jane was not happy . <end> <end> <end>
2.214129532982353
<start> <start> <start> she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley . <end> <end> <end>
1.8592188410672008
<start> <start> <start> having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . <end> <end> <end>
1.5761870633720834
<start> <start> <start> " well , lizzy ," said mrs . bennet one day , " what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of jane ' s ? <end> <end> <end>
2.2945680448627375
<start> <start> <start> for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . <end> <end> <end>
2.093497674899121
<start> <start> <start> but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london . <end> <end> <end>
2.1369947363443402
<start> <start> <start> well , he is a very undeserving young man -- and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . <end> <end> <end>
2.048672931878838
<start> <start> <start> there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2197675020838648
<start> <start> <start> " i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " oh , well ! <end> <end> <end>
2.2777130841092452
<start> <start> <start> it is just as he chooses . <end> <end> <end>
2.340583665625221
<start> <start> <start> nobody wants him to come . <end> <end> <end>
2.4352730709548878
<start> <start> <start> though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it . <end> <end> <end>
2.174459271529972
<start> <start> <start> well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1890143098375763
<start> <start> <start> but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer . <end> <end> <end>
1.9193313011257558
<start> <start> <start> " well , lizzy ," continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ? <end> <end> <end>
1.822943338937053
<start> <start> <start> well , well , i only hope it will last . <end> <end> <end>
2.359421227306585
<start> <start> <start> and what sort of table do they keep ? <end> <end> <end>
1.9489474076715063
<start> <start> <start> charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say . <end> <end> <end>
2.2752921281441436
<start> <start> <start> if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . <end> <end> <end>
2.1281258587051504
<start> <start> <start> there is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping , i dare say ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0517473185949537
<start> <start> <start> " no , nothing at all ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> well , much good may it do them ! <end> <end> <end>
1.8677347777568878
<start> <start> <start> and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead . <end> <end> <end>
1.80124152890456
<start> <start> <start> they look upon it quite as their own , i dare say , whenever that happens ." <end> <end> <end>
2.022825398961042
<start> <start> <start> " it was a subject which they could not mention before me ." <end> <end> <end>

2.6159332887859588
<start> <start> <start> it would have been strange if they had . <end> <end> <end>
2.1552605459600946
<start> <start> <start> but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves . <end> <end> <end>
1.8517191059740792
<start> <start> <start> well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better . <end> <end> <end>
1.80431934704891
<start> <start> <start> the second began . <end> <end> <end>
2.43188208332501
<start> <start> <start> the dejection was almost universal . <end> <end> <end>
2.116803407750509
<start> <start> <start> the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . <end> <end> <end>
1.5683787846883541
<start> <start> <start> very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard - heartedness in any of the family . <end> <end> <end>
1.7209487832196955
<start> <start> <start> " good heaven ! <end> <end> <end>
2.182513498211562
<start> <start> <start> what is to become of us ! <end> <end> <end>
2.271213318170795
<start> <start> <start> what are we to do !" <end> <end> <end>
2.1157323906677554
<start> <start> <start> would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe . <end> <end> <end>
1.8153909357507756
<start> <start> <start> " how can you be smiling so , lizzy ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.9602959663117399
<start> <start> <start> their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago . <end> <end> <end>
1.6621093701546268
<start> <start> <start> " i am sure i shall break _mine_ ," said lydia . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " if one could but go to brighton !" <end> <end> <end>
2.0494239613147167
<start> <start> <start> observed mrs . bennet . <end> <end> <end>
3.0942459003025444
<start> <start> <start> " oh , yes !-- if one could but go to brighton ! <end> <end> <end>
1.7809406771332639
<start> <start> <start> but papa is so disagreeable ." <end> <end> <end>
2.156637807585054
<start> <start> <start> " a little sea - bathing would set me up for ever ." <end> <end> <end>
1.6507670016960587
<start> <start> <start> " and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good ," added kitty . <end> <end> <end>
1.8619572753071152
<start> <start> <start> such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn - house . <end> <end> <end>
1.7885594630889274
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . <end> <end> <end>
1.7500111168676689
<start> <start> <start> she felt anew the justice of mr . darcy ' s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend . <end> <end> <end>
1.7927125701952682
<start> <start> <start> but the gloom of lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from mrs . forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton . <end> <end> <end>
1.8123598509759071
<start> <start> <start> this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married . <end> <end> <end>
2.2051470430081705
<start> <start> <start> a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their _three_ months ' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_ . <end> <end> <end>
1.7982212451625244
<start> <start> <start> the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs . forster , the delight of mrs . bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described . <end> <end> <end>
2.0410036259513165
<start> <start> <start> wholly inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . <end> <end> <end>
1.5052220038827486
<start> <start> <start> i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9228191337229548
<start> <start> <start> in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned . <end> <end> <end>
2.1630484211140666
<start> <start> <start> he heard her attentively , and then said , " lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8087960364847433
<start> <start> <start> " if you were aware ," said elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair ." <end> <end> <end>
1.881796057936395
<start> <start> <start> " already arisen !" <end> <end> <end>
2.4473136240949684
<start> <start> <start> repeated mr . bennet . <end> <end> <end>
3.0929681076153637
<start> <start> <start> poor little lizzy ! <end> <end> <end>
2.413317388912025
<start> <start> <start> such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret . <end> <end> <end>
1.7158230065181188
<start> <start> <start> i have no such injuries to resent . <end> <end> <end>
2.1441903924576273
<start> <start> <start> it is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which i am now complaining . <end> <end> <end>
1.9299480138155216
<start> <start> <start> excuse me -- for i must speak plainly . <end> <end> <end>
2.2156663663690614
<start> <start> <start> her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous . <end> <end> <end>
1.7827946972201039
<start> <start> <start> a flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . <end> <end> <end>
1.4625597593591664
<start> <start> <start> in this danger kitty is also comprehended . <end> <end> <end>
1.930954061977338
<start> <start> <start> she will follow wherever lydia leads . <end> <end> <end>
1.9916867576687678
<start> <start> <start> vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled ! <end> <end> <end>
1.87644594818782
<start> <start> <start> my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.9150442792644482
<start> <start> <start> wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or i may say , three very silly sisters . <end> <end> <end>
1.7970906146581367
<start> <start> <start> let her go then . <end> <end> <end>
2.4052219455130146
<start> <start> <start> colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body . <end> <end> <end>
1.8534400367074442
<start> <start> <start> at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . <end> <end> <end>
1.8348658036373455
<start> <start> <start> the officers will find women better worth their notice . <end> <end> <end>
1.8009464487021956
<start> <start> <start> let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . <end> <end> <end>
2.0223072035391065
<start> <start> <start> at any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7791388380163429
<start> <start> <start> with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . <end> <end> <end>
1.979975741447697
<start> <start> <start> it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them . <end> <end> <end>
1.9608263493267155
<start> <start> <start> she was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition . <end> <end> <end>
1.6467413061893634
<start> <start> <start> in lydia ' s imagination , a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness . <end> <end> <end>
1.932380727813532
<start> <start> <start> she saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers . <end> <end> <end>
1.5115208860968021
<start> <start> <start> she saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown . <end> <end> <end>
1.7932238053564993
<start> <start> <start> she saw all the glories of the camp ; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once . <end> <end> <end>
1.4131228955320587
<start> <start> <start> had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? <end> <end> <end>
1.718810516741872
<start> <start> <start> they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same . <end> <end> <end>
2.0307983764581783
<start> <start> <start> lydia ' s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself . <end> <end> <end>
1.8919273756974804
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was now to see mr . wickham for the last time . <end> <end> <end>
2.56587109914307
<start> <start> <start> having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so . <end> <end> <end>
1.561730496974136
<start> <start> <start> she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary . <end> <end> <end>
1.5458945683410068
<start> <start> <start> in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . <end> <end> <end>
1.6587690972186822
<start> <start> <start> she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal . <end> <end> <end>
1.5129107353365954
<start> <start> <start> on the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in meryton , he dined with others of the officers at longbourn ; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam ' s and mr . darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former . <end> <end> <end>
1.8992607913395707
<start> <start> <start> he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman - like man , asked her how she had liked him . <end> <end> <end>
1.8434701378891623
<start> <start> <start> her answer was warmly in his favour . <end> <end> <end>
2.0926661436600322
<start> <start> <start> with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " how long did you say that he was at rosings ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.587492537303263
<start> <start> <start> " nearly three weeks ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2636360252208934
<start> <start> <start> " and you saw him frequently ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.151017660609454
<start> <start> <start> " yes , almost every day ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2160538580666307
<start> <start> <start> but i think mr . darcy improves on acquaintance ." <end> <end> <end>
2.6421561858573384
<start> <start> <start> " indeed !" <end> <end> <end>
2.3876944830901925
<start> <start> <start> cried wickham with a look which did not escape her . <end> <end> <end>
1.9188993519713928
<start> <start> <start> " and pray may i ask ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.2506020020146233
<start> <start> <start> but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , " is it in address that he improves ? <end> <end> <end>
2.044738451846145
<start> <start> <start> has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? <end> <end> <end>

2.002535435917152
<start> <start> <start> while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning . <end> <end> <end>
1.7607118712376493
<start> <start> <start> there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , " when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood ." <end> <end> <end>
1.6552806463570988
<start> <start> <start> wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , " you , who so well know my feelings towards mr . darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right . <end> <end> <end>
1.7746491242299673
<start> <start> <start> his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by . <end> <end> <end>
1.9034700270081721
<start> <start> <start> his fear of her , has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9911869941293072
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . <end> <end> <end>
1.8097948734769642
<start> <start> <start> she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . <end> <end> <end>
1.8145449583594873
<start> <start> <start> the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_ , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . <end> <end> <end>
1.7169992219353014
<start> <start> <start> the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic . <end> <end> <end>

1.928142979630321
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . <end> <end> <end>

2.2704477686791944
<start> <start> <start> had elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort . <end> <end> <end>
2.013416037433012
<start> <start> <start> respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown . <end> <end> <end>
1.6452844314652981
<start> <start> <start> but mr . bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> he was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments . <end> <end> <end>

1.7716501256086878
<start> <start> <start> this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given . <end> <end> <end>
1.5671961534580818
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband . <end> <end> <end>
2.3585323027457794
<start> <start> <start> when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . <end> <end> <end>
2.0420410996643725
<start> <start> <start> their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp . <end> <end> <end>
1.4326361648345225
<start> <start> <start> upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . <end> <end> <end>
1.833989359422644
<start> <start> <start> her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . <end> <end> <end>
1.7759070374362274
<start> <start> <start> " but it is fortunate ," thought she , " that i have something to wish for . <end> <end> <end>

1.781857762400506
<start> <start> <start> but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister ' s absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized . <end> <end> <end>
1.6825262534213261
<start> <start> <start> a scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation ." <end> <end> <end>
1.5306105690558975
<start> <start> <start> when lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short . <end> <end> <end>
1.7356982667404344
<start> <start> <start> those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs . forster called her , and they were going to the camp ;-- and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt -- for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public . <end> <end> <end>
1.8618810227553197
<start> <start> <start> after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re - appear at longbourn . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> everything wore a happier aspect . <end> <end> <end>
2.1128151360185963
<start> <start> <start> the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . <end> <end> <end>
1.9669833561614933
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war - office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton . <end> <end> <end>
1.523318639771897
<start> <start> <start> the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs . gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent . <end> <end> <end>
1.6615494354399027
<start> <start> <start> mr . gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire . <end> <end> <end>
1.7055457888849619
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough . <end> <end> <end>
1.6913342060983099
<start> <start> <start> but it was her business to be satisfied -- and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . <end> <end> <end>
1.8412896492523283
<start> <start> <start> it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner . <end> <end> <end>
2.1046623908409723
<start> <start> <start> " but surely ," said she , " i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> the period of expectation was now doubled . <end> <end> <end>

2.0493468628263267
<start> <start> <start> but they did pass away , and mr . and mrs . gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn . <end> <end> <end>
1.9854528371147833
<start> <start> <start> the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way -- teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . <end> <end> <end>
1.5542001935074954
<start> <start> <start> one enjoyment was certain -- that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences -- cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure -- and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad . <end> <end> <end>

1.7804284056696273
<start> <start> <start> in talking over their route the evening before , mrs . gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again . <end> <end> <end>
2.1327567797275555
<start> <start> <start> mr . gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . <end> <end> <end>

2.1736009373588696
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was distressed . <end> <end> <end>
2.3658453352568505
<start> <start> <start> she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . <end> <end> <end>
2.5129185532905884
<start> <start> <start> she must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains . <end> <end> <end>
1.5902611466073886
<start> <start> <start> " if it were merely a fine house richly furnished ," said she , " i should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . <end> <end> <end>
1.971343041879295
<start> <start> <start> they have some of the finest woods in the country ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2448455290325398
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth said no more -- but her mind could not acquiesce . <end> <end> <end>
1.958018810205924
<start> <start> <start> the possibility of meeting mr . darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . <end> <end> <end>
2.348440192497844
<start> <start> <start> it would be dreadful ! <end> <end> <end>
2.8149857144522135
<start> <start> <start> she blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk . <end> <end> <end>
1.7778541126538712
<start> <start> <start> but against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered . <end> <end> <end>
2.029805690429875
<start> <start> <start> accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer . <end> <end> <end>
1.781682190668385
<start> <start> <start> a most welcome negative followed the last question -- and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . <end> <end> <end>

1.7129809703996992
<start> <start> <start> they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent . <end> <end> <end>

1.6835053994175528
<start> <start> <start> they gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings . <end> <end> <end>

2.045443592506666
<start> <start> <start> said mr . gardiner . <end> <end> <end>
3.5716752683991477
<start> <start> <start> yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished !-- she plays and sings all day long . <end> <end> <end>
1.6737265886938177
<start> <start> <start> in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her -- a present from my master ; she comes here to - morrow with him ." <end> <end> <end>
1.6144711370979274
<start> <start> <start> mr . gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; mrs . reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . <end> <end> <end>

1.9814126974600432
<start> <start> <start> " not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months ." <end> <end> <end>
1.934149291925578
<start> <start> <start> " except ," thought elizabeth , " when she goes to ramsgate ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2236645936791253
<start> <start> <start> " if your master would marry , you might see more of him ." <end> <end> <end>
1.848478177294135
<start> <start> <start> i do not know who is good enough for him ." <end> <end> <end>
2.083354976046758
<start> <start> <start> mr . and mrs . gardiner smiled . <end> <end> <end>
2.5377486212329288
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth could not help saying , " it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5765768209332687
<start> <start> <start> " i say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him ," replied the other . <end> <end> <end>
1.958905221660911
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " i have never had a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old ." <end> <end> <end>
1.994967356236101
<start> <start> <start> this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . <end> <end> <end>
1.616924394122397
<start> <start> <start> that he was not a good - tempered man , had been her firmest opinion . <end> <end> <end>
2.5307254326273423
<start> <start> <start> you are lucky in having such a master ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9558649723764783
<start> <start> <start> " yes , sir , i know i am . <end> <end> <end>
2.5196400097813036
<start> <start> <start> if i was to go through the world , i could not meet with a better . <end> <end> <end>
2.4024891888685183
<start> <start> <start> but i have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest - tempered , most generous - hearted , boy in the world ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7753363191544844
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth almost stared at her .--" can this be mr . <end> <end> <end>
1.847080114066248
<start> <start> <start> thought she . <end> <end> <end>
2.743667740675256
<start> <start> <start> " his father was an excellent man ," said mrs . gardiner . <end> <end> <end>
2.100340019283762
<start> <start> <start> " yes , ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8565601012345445
<start> <start> <start> mrs . reynolds could interest her on no other point . <end> <end> <end>
1.8237532107027479
<start> <start> <start> she related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain . <end> <end> <end>
1.9795012814517507
<start> <start> <start> " he is the best landlord , and the best master ," said she , " that ever lived . <end> <end> <end>
2.359920584241967
<start> <start> <start> not like the wild young men now - a - days , who think of nothing but themselves . <end> <end> <end>
1.706786419973021
<start> <start> <start> there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . <end> <end> <end>
1.8595452411935696
<start> <start> <start> some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it . <end> <end> <end>
2.5788411738007095
<start> <start> <start> to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2103087587019394
<start> <start> <start> " in what an amiable light does this place him !" <end> <end> <end>
1.8600890651585555
<start> <start> <start> " this fine account of him ," whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1463382439754977
<start> <start> <start> " perhaps we might be deceived ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0370157585200324
<start> <start> <start> " that is not very likely ; our authority was too good ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7659597326886658
<start> <start> <start> on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting - room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at pemberley . <end> <end> <end>
1.8119117515104979
<start> <start> <start> mrs . reynolds anticipated miss darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.2443422465763505
<start> <start> <start> " and this is always the way with him ," she added .--" whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . <end> <end> <end>
1.7957557832958742
<start> <start> <start> there is nothing he would not do for her ." <end> <end> <end>
2.291044076530757
<start> <start> <start> the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed - rooms , were all that remained to be shewn . <end> <end> <end>
1.8491465591333909
<start> <start> <start> in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy ' s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible . <end> <end> <end>
1.7626035412703813
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . <end> <end> <end>
1.7880854223563645
<start> <start> <start> at last it arrested her -- and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr . darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her . <end> <end> <end>
2.0239004976716948
<start> <start> <start> she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery . <end> <end> <end>
1.6139106313219862
<start> <start> <start> mrs . reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s life time . <end> <end> <end>
2.382570148011542
<start> <start> <start> the commendation bestowed on him by mrs . reynolds was of no trifling nature . <end> <end> <end>
1.9925571182520252
<start> <start> <start> what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? <end> <end> <end>
1.7190573814548726
<start> <start> <start> as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables . <end> <end> <end>
1.64969655341642
<start> <start> <start> they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . <end> <end> <end>
2.0883962890545478
<start> <start> <start> their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . <end> <end> <end>
2.0011428524961654
<start> <start> <start> he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility . <end> <end> <end>
1.7776858412478147
<start> <start> <start> she had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . <end> <end> <end>
1.655654168007503
<start> <start> <start> had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr . darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . <end> <end> <end>
1.569575834114363
<start> <start> <start> they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family . <end> <end> <end>
1.626462730844359
<start> <start> <start> amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life . <end> <end> <end>
1.674647865935774
<start> <start> <start> nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts . <end> <end> <end>
1.7565257849088751
<start> <start> <start> at length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave . <end> <end> <end>
1.980370880596938
<start> <start> <start> the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . <end> <end> <end>
2.0120198882269835
<start> <start> <start> she was overpowered by shame and vexation . <end> <end> <end>
1.9139864259141988
<start> <start> <start> her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill - judged thing in the world ! <end> <end> <end>
1.9776067329700375
<start> <start> <start> how strange must it appear to him ! <end> <end> <end>
1.983504845482972
<start> <start> <start> in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! <end> <end> <end>
1.6880802351781228
<start> <start> <start> why did she come ? <end> <end> <end>
2.2641648577494733
<start> <start> <start> or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? <end> <end> <end>
1.9293242620610431
<start> <start> <start> had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage . <end> <end> <end>
1.7291707112126986
<start> <start> <start> she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . <end> <end> <end>
1.9713502805648844
<start> <start> <start> and his behaviour , so strikingly altered ,-- what could it mean ? <end> <end> <end>
1.7088999878591702
<start> <start> <start> that he should even speak to her was amazing !-- but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! <end> <end> <end>
1.8136681866518973
<start> <start> <start> never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . <end> <end> <end>
1.5049657211253458
<start> <start> <start> her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr . darcy then was . <end> <end> <end>
2.0210873875205198
<start> <start> <start> she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him . <end> <end> <end>
2.213872398528793
<start> <start> <start> perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _that_ in his voice , which was not like ease . <end> <end> <end>
1.8182319648409908
<start> <start> <start> whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . <end> <end> <end>
2.082178438092287
<start> <start> <start> at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.0195500116077456
<start> <start> <start> they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream . <end> <end> <end>
1.4966443426307232
<start> <start> <start> mr . gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk . <end> <end> <end>
1.7850510042991894
<start> <start> <start> with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round . <end> <end> <end>
2.262756476891411
<start> <start> <start> it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts . <end> <end> <end>
1.773297060225732
<start> <start> <start> they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice - wood which bordered it . <end> <end> <end>
1.5709172464189276
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs . gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . <end> <end> <end>
1.8635858445260134
<start> <start> <start> her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr . gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . <end> <end> <end>
1.8643242047530688
<start> <start> <start> whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr . darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . <end> <end> <end>
2.5463623569681246
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . <end> <end> <end>
1.6941392533823718
<start> <start> <start> this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them . <end> <end> <end>
1.6495688493936245
<start> <start> <start> with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful ," and " charming ," when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed . <end> <end> <end>
1.863473859437603
<start> <start> <start> her colour changed , and she said no more . <end> <end> <end>
2.5177126820321263
<start> <start> <start> mrs . gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . <end> <end> <end>
2.0388073486740605
<start> <start> <start> he takes them now for people of fashion ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8981773778600066
<start> <start> <start> the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . <end> <end> <end>
1.9570638802687133
<start> <start> <start> that he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr . gardiner . <end> <end> <end>
1.92144085759765
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . <end> <end> <end>
2.2501948388244135
<start> <start> <start> it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . <end> <end> <end>
2.0249564317633935
<start> <start> <start> she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners . <end> <end> <end>
1.7233316714224853
<start> <start> <start> the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr . darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . <end> <end> <end>
1.8174454266563094
<start> <start> <start> mrs . gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder . <end> <end> <end>
1.7650699341888738
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . <end> <end> <end>
1.8879551828647139
<start> <start> <start> her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " why is he so altered ? <end> <end> <end>
1.8397921745180625
<start> <start> <start> it cannot be for _me_ , it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened . <end> <end> <end>
1.8095679937899478
<start> <start> <start> my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this . <end> <end> <end>
1.7762448244381013
<start> <start> <start> after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water - plant , there chanced to be a little alteration . <end> <end> <end>
1.6632810415780375
<start> <start> <start> after a short silence , the lady first spoke . <end> <end> <end>
2.01430483470383
<start> <start> <start> she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected --" for your housekeeper ," she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8767425834582077
<start> <start> <start> he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . <end> <end> <end>
1.970732120660339
<start> <start> <start> " they will join me early to - morrow ," he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you ,-- mr . bingley and his sisters ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9156206346514437
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . <end> <end> <end>
2.3003298279314808
<start> <start> <start> her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr . bingley ' s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , _his_ mind was not very differently engaged . <end> <end> <end>
2.027024213821168
<start> <start> <start> she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . <end> <end> <end>
2.0360568590383763
<start> <start> <start> they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought . <end> <end> <end>
2.116922833230193
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . <end> <end> <end>
1.9684011280389626
<start> <start> <start> his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind . <end> <end> <end>
2.3221816532157407
<start> <start> <start> they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr . and mrs . gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . <end> <end> <end>
2.3678323693117185
<start> <start> <start> he then asked her to walk into the house -- but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . <end> <end> <end>
1.7756536453113259
<start> <start> <start> at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . <end> <end> <end>
1.9929577144308537
<start> <start> <start> she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject . <end> <end> <end>
1.9831263903280465
<start> <start> <start> at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance . <end> <end> <end>
2.1529320219146686
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house . <end> <end> <end>
1.8489781011106063
<start> <start> <start> the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected . <end> <end> <end>
1.8495177096509754
<start> <start> <start> " there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure ," replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . <end> <end> <end>
2.0993036275385784
<start> <start> <start> i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , _i_ have seen nothing of it ." <end> <end> <end>
1.6286668043722103
<start> <start> <start> " i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . <end> <end> <end>
2.117393187499034
<start> <start> <start> it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . <end> <end> <end>
2.171368649937738
<start> <start> <start> " to be sure , lizzy ," said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as wickham ; or rather he has not wickham ' s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . <end> <end> <end>
2.193136777642579
<start> <start> <start> but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.1740286340702526
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . <end> <end> <end>
2.183972553840376
<start> <start> <start> " your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds ." <end> <end> <end>
1.746229852787681
<start> <start> <start> " from what we have seen of him ," continued mrs . gardiner , " i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham . <end> <end> <end>
1.9408898649398802
<start> <start> <start> he has not an ill - natured look . <end> <end> <end>
2.2633206180043373
<start> <start> <start> on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks . <end> <end> <end>
1.9193552116289534
<start> <start> <start> and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . <end> <end> <end>
1.940190958273042
<start> <start> <start> but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8534359535829519
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire . <end> <end> <end>
1.9102329645372826
<start> <start> <start> in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on . <end> <end> <end>
1.9259883586499607
<start> <start> <start> fatigued as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance . <end> <end> <end>
1.843046336298238
<start> <start> <start> the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr . darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . <end> <end> <end>
1.9184238513242866
<start> <start> <start> chapter ii . <end> <end> <end>
2.2704477686791944
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth had settled it that mr . darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . <end> <end> <end>
2.026290491564735
<start> <start> <start> but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton , these visitors came . <end> <end> <end>
1.7695513054810075
<start> <start> <start> they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street . <end> <end> <end>
1.7877429883055975
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected . <end> <end> <end>
1.4076699562938628
<start> <start> <start> her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . <end> <end> <end>
1.747542515652037
<start> <start> <start> nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece . <end> <end> <end>
1.65931290910683
<start> <start> <start> while these newly - born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing . <end> <end> <end>
1.7599418684845418
<start> <start> <start> she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . <end> <end> <end>
1.4270817964026945
<start> <start> <start> she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse . <end> <end> <end>
1.8400848629093947
<start> <start> <start> miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . <end> <end> <end>
1.8203275055743937
<start> <start> <start> since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy . <end> <end> <end>
2.3297852668219146
<start> <start> <start> she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable . <end> <end> <end>
1.662737157640905
<start> <start> <start> miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful . <end> <end> <end>
1.966237919132577
<start> <start> <start> she was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . <end> <end> <end>
2.04478279054681
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr . darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings . <end> <end> <end>
1.8454034579253997
<start> <start> <start> they had not been long together , before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . <end> <end> <end>
2.011127063074123
<start> <start> <start> all elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again . <end> <end> <end>
1.756721069811524
<start> <start> <start> he enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good - humoured ease that he had ever done . <end> <end> <end>
2.0499804603924927
<start> <start> <start> to mr . and mrs . gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.0749356760531916
<start> <start> <start> they had long wished to see him . <end> <end> <end>
2.411033454742439
<start> <start> <start> the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . <end> <end> <end>
2.146136378197224
<start> <start> <start> the suspicions which had just arisen of mr . darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love . <end> <end> <end>
1.7047951477236538
<start> <start> <start> of the lady ' s sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough . <end> <end> <end>
1.657781389045374
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . <end> <end> <end>
2.176533343811543
<start> <start> <start> she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour . <end> <end> <end>
1.9082406603840156
<start> <start> <start> bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased . <end> <end> <end>
2.0329373898825085
<start> <start> <start> in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! <end> <end> <end>
2.1601248086823834
<start> <start> <start> how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner . <end> <end> <end>
1.7884647370106321
<start> <start> <start> sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . <end> <end> <end>
1.886497432904848
<start> <start> <start> but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival of jane . <end> <end> <end>
2.1366348404730813
<start> <start> <start> no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . <end> <end> <end>
1.93815316240049
<start> <start> <start> nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . <end> <end> <end>
1.8580520394303732
<start> <start> <start> on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . <end> <end> <end>
1.7919262745997164
<start> <start> <start> he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ;" and , before she could reply , he added , " it is above eight months . <end> <end> <end>
2.084882540598191
<start> <start> <start> we have not met since the 26th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7602724237604774
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn . <end> <end> <end>
1.7682228203303627
<start> <start> <start> there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . <end> <end> <end>
2.017816020530665
<start> <start> <start> it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr . darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day . <end> <end> <end>
1.7572250194890384
<start> <start> <start> when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . <end> <end> <end>
1.6055969902826193
<start> <start> <start> never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self - consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings . <end> <end> <end>
1.542710761278783
<start> <start> <start> their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , mr . darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr . and mrs . gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country . <end> <end> <end>
2.2057285867672873
<start> <start> <start> miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed . <end> <end> <end>
1.8585147401131972
<start> <start> <start> mrs . gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how _she_ , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head . <end> <end> <end>
1.5741460954300082
<start> <start> <start> presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . <end> <end> <end>
1.8286176273781038
<start> <start> <start> bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends . <end> <end> <end>
2.0201232833883473
<start> <start> <start> eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress . <end> <end> <end>
1.8793957881799
<start> <start> <start> but she had no reason to fear mr . and mrs . gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . <end> <end> <end>
2.4039289119115694
<start> <start> <start> it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr . darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . <end> <end> <end>
2.4364304664422534
<start> <start> <start> they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry . <end> <end> <end>
1.8994887935276583
<start> <start> <start> of mr . darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . <end> <end> <end>
2.531195799770162
<start> <start> <start> neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight . <end> <end> <end>
1.7408558086244115
<start> <start> <start> they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market - town , where the family did not visit . <end> <end> <end>
1.6803838919403258
<start> <start> <start> with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr . darcy afterwards discharged . <end> <end> <end>
2.0237666894189417
<start> <start> <start> as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . <end> <end> <end>
1.8653788395751336
<start> <start> <start> no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . <end> <end> <end>
1.8790863568844791
<start> <start> <start> the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . <end> <end> <end>
1.555055308267423
<start> <start> <start> but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked . <end> <end> <end>
1.9222181343217755
<start> <start> <start> it was gratitude .-- gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . <end> <end> <end>
1.598474243799257
<start> <start> <start> he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . <end> <end> <end>
1.6524962334805149
<start> <start> <start> such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude -- for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined . <end> <end> <end>
1.754690345468112
<start> <start> <start> she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . <end> <end> <end>
1.8853291105362338
<start> <start> <start> it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning . <end> <end> <end>
1.9584518136587876
<start> <start> <start> they were , therefore , to go .-- elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . <end> <end> <end>
2.149622338127277
<start> <start> <start> the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon . <end> <end> <end>
1.898432600332714
<start> <start> <start> convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley ' s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s side , the acquaintance would now be renewed . <end> <end> <end>
1.8303923611474198
<start> <start> <start> on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . <end> <end> <end>
1.8353035417416295
<start> <start> <start> its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn . <end> <end> <end>
1.625258171732018
<start> <start> <start> in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs . hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london . <end> <end> <end>
2.2533999177965827
<start> <start> <start> georgiana ' s reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved . <end> <end> <end>
1.5038962516613907
<start> <start> <start> it was first broken by mrs . annesley , a genteel , agreeable - looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs . gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . <end> <end> <end>
1.632653365284011
<start> <start> <start> miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . <end> <end> <end>
1.7900999241696525
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention . <end> <end> <end>
2.409249127538854
<start> <start> <start> this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much . <end> <end> <end>
1.8664023203210292
<start> <start> <start> her own thoughts were employing her . <end> <end> <end>
2.0432209874242417
<start> <start> <start> she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . <end> <end> <end>
1.8081469685266345
<start> <start> <start> after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley ' s voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family . <end> <end> <end>
1.82636146805753
<start> <start> <start> the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs . annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . <end> <end> <end>
1.621850252404335
<start> <start> <start> there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table . <end> <end> <end>
1.722457750160917
<start> <start> <start> while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr . darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came . <end> <end> <end>
1.8107170436120656
<start> <start> <start> he had been some time with mr . gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning . <end> <end> <end>
2.103248593784108
<start> <start> <start> in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr . darcy were by no means over . <end> <end> <end>
1.9484469981266799
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , " pray , miss eliza , are not the ---- shire militia removed from meryton ? <end> <end> <end>
1.8942178332801727
<start> <start> <start> they must be a great loss to _your_ family ." <end> <end> <end>
2.113601065125844
<start> <start> <start> in darcy ' s presence she dared not mention wickham ' s name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . <end> <end> <end>
1.8954055136126768
<start> <start> <start> while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . <end> <end> <end>
1.7646533546574723
<start> <start> <start> had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . <end> <end> <end>
1.7605895094303312
<start> <start> <start> not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy ' s meditated elopement . <end> <end> <end>
1.9816329983133323
<start> <start> <start> to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . <end> <end> <end>
1.7662411691206268
<start> <start> <start> he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . <end> <end> <end>
1.7910539642721386
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . <end> <end> <end>
1.9571392518610238
<start> <start> <start> her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully . <end> <end> <end>
1.8887847504262703
<start> <start> <start> their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above - mentioned ; and while mr . darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress . <end> <end> <end>
1.7760578443523247
<start> <start> <start> her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . <end> <end> <end>
1.82646936591627
<start> <start> <start> when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . <end> <end> <end>
2.1659089485151437
<start> <start> <start> " how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr . darcy ," she cried ; " i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter . <end> <end> <end>
2.0544001844394555
<start> <start> <start> she is grown so brown and coarse ! <end> <end> <end>
1.880252600023706
<start> <start> <start> louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again ." <end> <end> <end>
2.176190581746079
<start> <start> <start> however little mr . darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned ,-- no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . <end> <end> <end>
1.6493753079290314
<start> <start> <start> her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . <end> <end> <end>
1.9377341316772325
<start> <start> <start> her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them . <end> <end> <end>
1.8687033704404317
<start> <start> <start> persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected . <end> <end> <end>
1.852551450023179
<start> <start> <start> but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9923890367245665
<start> <start> <start> he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . <end> <end> <end>
2.1254508019285527
<start> <start> <start> the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention . <end> <end> <end>
1.7252234874297228
<start> <start> <start> they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs . gardiner thought of him , and mrs . gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ' s beginning the subject . <end> <end> <end>
2.191196957657251
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere . <end> <end> <end>
1.6917010175007972
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill . they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . <end> <end> <end>
1.672558863404033
<start> <start> <start> the one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . <end> <end> <end>
1.7941952313090654
<start> <start> <start> the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . <end> <end> <end>
1.602284200083979
<start> <start> <start> it was to this effect : " since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but i am afraid of alarming you -- be assured that we are all well . <end> <end> <end>
1.7572204516856245
<start> <start> <start> what i have to say relates to poor lydia . <end> <end> <end>
2.168056202103694
<start> <start> <start> an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with wickham !-- imagine our surprise . <end> <end> <end>
1.6800568838146646
<start> <start> <start> to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . <end> <end> <end>
2.6748509548060624
<start> <start> <start> i am very , very sorry . <end> <end> <end>
2.413719632548443
<start> <start> <start> so imprudent a match on both sides !-- but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . <end> <end> <end>
1.9594624966403495
<start> <start> <start> thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart . <end> <end> <end>
1.5847667790112174
<start> <start> <start> his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . <end> <end> <end>
1.8372580828143277
<start> <start> <start> our poor mother is sadly grieved . <end> <end> <end>
2.1376942419441174
<start> <start> <start> my father bears it better . <end> <end> <end>
2.0951637370113327
<start> <start> <start> how thankful am i , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . <end> <end> <end>
1.6501464946496691
<start> <start> <start> they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . <end> <end> <end>
1.486608382348496
<start> <start> <start> the express was sent off directly . <end> <end> <end>
2.0981901955390483
<start> <start> <start> my dear lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . <end> <end> <end>
2.011689799101197
<start> <start> <start> lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . <end> <end> <end>
1.9207886627881146
<start> <start> <start> i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother . <end> <end> <end>
2.1279715899181553
<start> <start> <start> i am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but i hardly know what i have written ." <end> <end> <end>
2.828651267270158
<start> <start> <start> without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . <end> <end> <end>
1.7502285391040937
<start> <start> <start> dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would write , but i have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed . <end> <end> <end>
2.5992928380113427
<start> <start> <start> imprudent as a marriage between mr . wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland . <end> <end> <end>
1.7874982657684828
<start> <start> <start> colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . <end> <end> <end>
1.7755718438491714
<start> <start> <start> though lydia ' s short letter to mrs . f . gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green , something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w . never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f . who instantly taking the alarm , set off from b . intending to trace their route . <end> <end> <end>
1.6919659266746128
<start> <start> <start> he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney - coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom . <end> <end> <end>
1.4226255937426504
<start> <start> <start> i know not what to think . <end> <end> <end>

1.6457346190492899
<start> <start> <start> i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs . f . but no one can throw any blame on them . <end> <end> <end>
2.0906882142482477
<start> <start> <start> our distress , my dear lizzy , is very great . <end> <end> <end>
2.5319829636119295
<start> <start> <start> my father and mother believe the worst , but i cannot think so ill of him . <end> <end> <end>
2.273037877083317
<start> <start> <start> many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to every thing ?-- impossible . <end> <end> <end>
1.6607721492750978
<start> <start> <start> i grieve to find , however , that colonel f . is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes , and said he feared w . was not a man to be trusted . <end> <end> <end>
1.8311332513169183
<start> <start> <start> my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room . <end> <end> <end>
1.8935207996094243
<start> <start> <start> could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected . <end> <end> <end>
2.2782730334884853
<start> <start> <start> i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall i own that i long for your return ? <end> <end> <end>
1.804649990340216
<start> <start> <start> i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . <end> <end> <end>

3.017824076896552

2.0277420179174084
<start> <start> <start> my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her . <end> <end> <end>
1.831023772825949
<start> <start> <start> in such an exigence my uncle ' s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his goodness ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9170691874714638
<start> <start> <start> where , where is my uncle ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.1212572486509322
<start> <start> <start> cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and mr . darcy appeared . <end> <end> <end>
1.9368472723476338
<start> <start> <start> her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " i beg your pardon , but i must leave you . <end> <end> <end>
1.8090080640914004
<start> <start> <start> i must find mr . gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; i have not an instant to lose ." <end> <end> <end>
1.965673459388629
<start> <start> <start> " good god ! <end> <end> <end>
2.3848574192461265
<start> <start> <start> what is the matter ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.587374595145883
<start> <start> <start> cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " i will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after mr . and mrs . gardiner . <end> <end> <end>
1.9561806290562944
<start> <start> <start> you are not well enough ;-- you cannot go yourself ." <end> <end> <end>
1.968589489720988
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them . <end> <end> <end>
1.879533716863747
<start> <start> <start> calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly . <end> <end> <end>
1.718168763840431
<start> <start> <start> on his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , " let me call your maid . <end> <end> <end>
2.007461376631711
<start> <start> <start> is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ?-- a glass of wine ;-- shall i get you one ?-- you are very ill ." " no , i thank you ;" she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . <end> <end> <end>
1.6820026720985082
<start> <start> <start> " there is nothing the matter with me . <end> <end> <end>
2.1705582053584855
<start> <start> <start> i am quite well . <end> <end> <end>
2.6434771850696386
<start> <start> <start> i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8349581918771114
<start> <start> <start> she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word . <end> <end> <end>
2.1178815164800215
<start> <start> <start> darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . <end> <end> <end>
1.7033835612804702
<start> <start> <start> at length , she spoke again . <end> <end> <end>
2.28080322521044
<start> <start> <start> " i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news . <end> <end> <end>
2.1732954700427936
<start> <start> <start> it cannot be concealed from any one . <end> <end> <end>
2.146078579012242
<start> <start> <start> they are gone off together from brighton . <end> <end> <end>
1.9070236436686105
<start> <start> <start> darcy was fixed in astonishment . <end> <end> <end>
2.1173995734628184
<start> <start> <start> " when i consider ," she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that _i_ might have prevented it !-- _i_ who knew what he was . <end> <end> <end>
1.979970720043894
<start> <start> <start> had his character been known , this could not have happened . <end> <end> <end>
2.119814168330295
<start> <start> <start> but it is all , all too late now ." <end> <end> <end>
2.308776340598032
<start> <start> <start> " i am grieved , indeed ," cried darcy ; " grieved -- shocked . <end> <end> <end>
1.7563551201179612
<start> <start> <start> " oh yes !-- they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced almost to london , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to scotland ." <end> <end> <end>
1.6754943265059652
<start> <start> <start> " and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ?" <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> how is such a man to be worked on ? <end> <end> <end>
2.431383163841003
<start> <start> <start> i have not the smallest hope . <end> <end> <end>
2.296396434254914
<start> <start> <start> darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence . <end> <end> <end>
2.1134445485719366
<start> <start> <start> but i knew not -- i was afraid of doing too much . <end> <end> <end>
1.8834975037511201
<start> <start> <start> wretched , wretched , mistake !" <end> <end> <end>
2.165945548905882
<start> <start> <start> darcy made no answer . <end> <end> <end>
2.201975594068698
<start> <start> <start> he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air gloomy . <end> <end> <end>
1.8560389966541389
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . <end> <end> <end>
1.9485013726438167
<start> <start> <start> her power was sinking ; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . <end> <end> <end>
1.5808715400497666
<start> <start> <start> she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self - conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress . <end> <end> <end>
1.5190797880044489
<start> <start> <start> it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . <end> <end> <end>
1.8648655068600681
<start> <start> <start> but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her . <end> <end> <end>
2.1339312640960424
<start> <start> <start> lydia -- the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern . <end> <end> <end>
1.7212656698110926
<start> <start> <start> would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress .-- but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . <end> <end> <end>
1.5142188795211966
<start> <start> <start> this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to - day ." <end> <end> <end>
2.104195360428421
<start> <start> <start> " oh , yes . <end> <end> <end>
2.1949790754809015
<start> <start> <start> say that urgent business calls us home immediately . <end> <end> <end>
1.8736230462062242
<start> <start> <start> conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible .-- i know it cannot be long ." <end> <end> <end>
2.049236931759435
<start> <start> <start> as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . <end> <end> <end>
1.5801972708858172
<start> <start> <start> but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill - success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . <end> <end> <end>
1.5438899292171835
<start> <start> <start> be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . <end> <end> <end>
1.757082511140133
<start> <start> <start> never , since reading jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of wickham ' s meaning to marry her . <end> <end> <end>
2.0043856082957157
<start> <start> <start> no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . <end> <end> <end>
2.1473109382732383
<start> <start> <start> surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement . <end> <end> <end>
2.288961583536268
<start> <start> <start> while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise -- all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible . <end> <end> <end>
1.717520539495631
<start> <start> <start> but now it was all too natural . <end> <end> <end>
2.2027386459515443
<start> <start> <start> for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey . <end> <end> <end>
1.706900779296103
<start> <start> <start> sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object . <end> <end> <end>
1.7558379939475948
<start> <start> <start> she was wild to be at home -- to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe . <end> <end> <end>
1.6799628173469174
<start> <start> <start> mr . and mrs . gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ;-- but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy .-- though lydia had never been a favourite with them , mr . and mrs . gardiner could not but be deeply affected . <end> <end> <end>
1.6636241176031374
<start> <start> <start> not lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , mr . gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .-- elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled . <end> <end> <end>
1.7055297944282637
<start> <start> <start> " but what is to be done about pemberley ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.4318849974038814

2.3616798904218004
<start> <start> <start> " that is all settled ;" repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> oh , that i knew how it was !" <end> <end> <end>
2.784894848081107
<start> <start> <start> but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . <end> <end> <end>
1.64374612422993
<start> <start> <start> had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> chapter v . " i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth ," said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> his temptation is not adequate to the risk ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8850072105594378
<start> <start> <start> cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment . <end> <end> <end>
2.2001391669375496
<start> <start> <start> " upon my word ," said mrs . gardiner , " i begin to be of your uncle ' s opinion . <end> <end> <end>
2.4993513702104693
<start> <start> <start> it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . <end> <end> <end>
1.7700574101148865
<start> <start> <start> i cannot think so very ill of wickham . <end> <end> <end>

2.3854851364756278

1.9404151070649074
<start> <start> <start> " in the first place ," replied mr . gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland ." <end> <end> <end>
2.218096591928605
<start> <start> <start> but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! <end> <end> <end>
1.8477389700855078
<start> <start> <start> and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road ." <end> <end> <end>

1.731559720800796
<start> <start> <start> it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland ." <end> <end> <end>
1.766622357315047
<start> <start> <start> " but why all this secrecy ? <end> <end> <end>

2.4695273495663126
<start> <start> <start> his most particular friend , you see by jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . <end> <end> <end>
1.894832151307151
<start> <start> <start> wickham will never marry a woman without some money . <end> <end> <end>
1.8415135541360512
<start> <start> <start> he cannot afford it . <end> <end> <end>

2.1841191696228566
<start> <start> <start> lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ' s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _he_ would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that _one_ only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . <end> <end> <end>

1.6227886898401571
<start> <start> <start> then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable -- that one false step involves her in endless ruin -- that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful ,-- and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex ." <end> <end> <end>

1.8135759838269039
<start> <start> <start> mr . gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> that mr . bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr . bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings . <end> <end> <end>
2.2242968801925005

2.0448737873319733
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved . <end> <end> <end>

1.7793456155537921

2.2267068859931176

<start> <start> <start> it was as follows : " my dear sir , " i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire . <end> <end> <end>
1.77715080825089
<start> <start> <start> be assured , my dear sir , that mrs . collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . <end> <end> <end>

2.3423715059407693
<start> <start> <start> and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs . bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . <end> <end> <end>
1.8571275193040357
<start> <start> <start> howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs . collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair . <end> <end> <end>
2.0711023151902377
<start> <start> <start> they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family . <end> <end> <end>
1.7262382900166569
<start> <start> <start> and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november , for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . <end> <end> <end>
1.610596417136356
<start> <start> <start> let me advise you then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence . <end> <end> <end>

1.8689275391434614
<start> <start> <start> and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia ' s relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount . <end> <end> <end>
1.9735804951177867

<start> <start> <start> he owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . <end> <end> <end>
1.9154972291331709
<start> <start> <start> mr . gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family ; jane heard them with horror . <end> <end> <end>

1.8667959063208244

2.031392934965597
<start> <start> <start> the present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from _that_ , though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydia ' s infamy somewhat better . <end> <end> <end>

2.1513984325918774
<start> <start> <start> poor lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . <end> <end> <end>
2.2960766807996955
<start> <start> <start> she felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> mr . bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him . <end> <end> <end>
1.9958835228754617
<start> <start> <start> he now wished it more than ever . <end> <end> <end>
2.0630675206294806
<start> <start> <start> the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place . <end> <end> <end>
1.8152454179659445
<start> <start> <start> he was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother - in - law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . <end> <end> <end>
1.8989572352743547
<start> <start> <start> when first mr . bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . <end> <end> <end>
2.194928577855171
<start> <start> <start> this son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for . <end> <end> <end>
1.8802495792861447
<start> <start> <start> five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and mrs . bennet , for many years after lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would . <end> <end> <end>
2.210002460234315
<start> <start> <start> this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . <end> <end> <end>
1.8370817642505446
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband ' s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income . <end> <end> <end>
1.8241228791756372
<start> <start> <start> five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs . bennet and the children . <end> <end> <end>
2.077487452869228
<start> <start> <start> but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents . <end> <end> <end>
1.7780898381180024
<start> <start> <start> this was one point , with regard to lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and mr . bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him . <end> <end> <end>
2.1231927438522686
<start> <start> <start> in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him . <end> <end> <end>
1.7525236330630456
<start> <start> <start> he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement . <end> <end> <end>
1.8412243385777862
<start> <start> <start> he would scarcely be ten pounds a - year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother ' s hands , lydia ' s expences had been very little within that sum . <end> <end> <end>
1.8217385472414205
<start> <start> <start> when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . <end> <end> <end>
1.5789573401459913
<start> <start> <start> his letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution . <end> <end> <end>
1.8922516389984907
<start> <start> <start> he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with lydia , to send any message to her . <end> <end> <end>
1.7308614949217487
<start> <start> <start> the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood . <end> <end> <end>
1.923246460551315
<start> <start> <start> it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . <end> <end> <end>
1.967484058324557
<start> <start> <start> to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house . <end> <end> <end>
1.9828427196541598
<start> <start> <start> but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good - natured wishes for her well - doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain . <end> <end> <end>
1.6465385710908793
<start> <start> <start> it was a fortnight since mrs . bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high . <end> <end> <end>
1.9052058025386074
<start> <start> <start> no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph . <end> <end> <end>
1.7611319316293428
<start> <start> <start> she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . <end> <end> <end>
1.6502271051646633
<start> <start> <start> " haye - park might do ," said she , " if the gouldings would quit it , or the great house at stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but ashworth is too far off ! <end> <end> <end>
1.777171525676727
<start> <start> <start> i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for purvis lodge , the attics are dreadful ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9507843575749604
<start> <start> <start> her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained . <end> <end> <end>
1.7900180721753995
<start> <start> <start> but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " mrs . bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . <end> <end> <end>
1.982288795258787
<start> <start> <start> into _one_ house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance . <end> <end> <end>
1.8111574392387484
<start> <start> <start> i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9062184175979175
<start> <start> <start> a long dispute followed this declaration ; but mr . bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and mrs . bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter . <end> <end> <end>
1.7775249017758226
<start> <start> <start> he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion . <end> <end> <end>
2.0221811537482925
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet could hardly comprehend it . <end> <end> <end>
2.12688039863511
<start> <start> <start> that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible . <end> <end> <end>
1.760846796381429
<start> <start> <start> she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place . <end> <end> <end>
1.62185638047379
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr . darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot . <end> <end> <end>
1.6567912042706563
<start> <start> <start> she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means . <end> <end> <end>
1.959414724803973
<start> <start> <start> there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s frailty would have mortified her so much . <end> <end> <end>
1.8724821166538927
<start> <start> <start> not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them . <end> <end> <end>
1.8313014613914416
<start> <start> <start> had lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr . darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned . <end> <end> <end>
1.7934458045396315
<start> <start> <start> from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink . <end> <end> <end>
2.558419368363439
<start> <start> <start> the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this . <end> <end> <end>
1.8554922329566819
<start> <start> <start> she was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what . <end> <end> <end>
2.0583424062043996
<start> <start> <start> she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it . <end> <end> <end>
2.101471443151888
<start> <start> <start> she was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet . <end> <end> <end>
2.3811022926062204
<start> <start> <start> what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received ! <end> <end> <end>
1.7805132232740313
<start> <start> <start> but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . <end> <end> <end>
2.0512639815206017
<start> <start> <start> she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . <end> <end> <end>
1.853536689696456
<start> <start> <start> his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . <end> <end> <end>
1.8946018618147058
<start> <start> <start> it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance . <end> <end> <end>
1.7647160420824768
<start> <start> <start> but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was . <end> <end> <end>
1.5339897418382955
<start> <start> <start> an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family . <end> <end> <end>
1.8323870695707771
<start> <start> <start> how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine . <end> <end> <end>
2.180667082880436
<start> <start> <start> but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . <end> <end> <end>
1.5307169715423083
<start> <start> <start> * * * * * mr . gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . <end> <end> <end>
2.2531177557272546
<start> <start> <start> to mr . bennet ' s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . <end> <end> <end>
1.7849071592478687
<start> <start> <start> the principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that mr . wickham had resolved on quitting the militia . <end> <end> <end>
2.2310583380730913
<start> <start> <start> and i think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s . <end> <end> <end>
1.792140922710749
<start> <start> <start> it is mr . wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . <end> <end> <end>
1.939172913277957
<start> <start> <start> he has the promise of an ensigncy in general ----' s regiment , now quartered in the north . <end> <end> <end>
1.671446867359937
<start> <start> <start> it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . <end> <end> <end>
2.1323852343121197
<start> <start> <start> he promises fairly , and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . <end> <end> <end>
1.763244866873639
<start> <start> <start> i have written to colonel forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr . wickham in and near brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which i have pledged myself . <end> <end> <end>
1.8047255440164314
<start> <start> <start> and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information . <end> <end> <end>
1.726513342642732
<start> <start> <start> he has given in all his debts ; i hope at least he has not deceived us . <end> <end> <end>

1.9946987039012631
<start> <start> <start> they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn ; and i understand from mrs . gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the south . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> mr . bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham ' s removal from the ---- shire , as clearly as mr . gardiner could do . <end> <end> <end>
2.2538083672432565
<start> <start> <start> but mrs . bennet , was not so well pleased with it . <end> <end> <end>
2.7591169143526524
<start> <start> <start> lydia ' s being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites . <end> <end> <end>
1.8766840814312626
<start> <start> <start> " she is so fond of mrs . forster ," said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! <end> <end> <end>

2.086278979724896
<start> <start> <start> his daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative . <end> <end> <end>
1.767380088707171
<start> <start> <start> but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . <end> <end> <end>
1.928921712510032

<start> <start> <start> smiles decked the face of mrs . bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy . <end> <end> <end>

1.5413130157419739
<start> <start> <start> she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there . <end> <end> <end>
2.1386492509251807
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man . <end> <end> <end>
1.6452859534349566

2.346740440911546
<start> <start> <start> the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> elizabeth looked expressively at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " oh ! <end> <end> <end>
1.841237642631349
<start> <start> <start> mamma , do the people here abouts know i am married to - day ? <end> <end> <end>
1.9081363173101031
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth could bear it no longer . <end> <end> <end>
2.0592928287498857
<start> <start> <start> she got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining - parlour . <end> <end> <end>
1.9535598148635558
<start> <start> <start> she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " ah ! <end> <end> <end>
1.8428159464494358
<start> <start> <start> it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first . <end> <end> <end>
1.9186378857141257
<start> <start> <start> her ease and good spirits increased . <end> <end> <end>
2.266838108529881
<start> <start> <start> she longed to see mrs . philips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " mrs . wickham ," by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to mrs . hill and the two housemaids . <end> <end> <end>
1.977459554948125
<start> <start> <start> i am sure my sisters must all envy me . <end> <end> <end>
2.0132704061406637
<start> <start> <start> i only hope they may have half my good luck . <end> <end> <end>
1.9482572078023492
<start> <start> <start> they must all go to brighton . <end> <end> <end>
2.2902426920554864
<start> <start> <start> what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go ." <end> <end> <end>
1.905618444543408
<start> <start> <start> " very true ; and if i had my will , we should . <end> <end> <end>
2.228031787570224
<start> <start> <start> must it be so ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.5219997689091356
<start> <start> <start> " oh , lord ! <end> <end> <end>
2.054456217257872
<start> <start> <start> yes ;-- there is nothing in that . <end> <end> <end>
2.47959126875945
<start> <start> <start> i shall like it of all things . <end> <end> <end>
2.1803220294311694
<start> <start> <start> you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . <end> <end> <end>
1.8292468381505746
<start> <start> <start> we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1724497613630405
<start> <start> <start> said her mother . <end> <end> <end>
2.853550392567821
<start> <start> <start> " and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over ." <end> <end> <end>
1.775518423287812
<start> <start> <start> " i thank you for my share of the favour ," said elizabeth ; " but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands ." <end> <end> <end>
2.189227089019433
<start> <start> <start> no one but mrs . bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . <end> <end> <end>
1.903881464985796
<start> <start> <start> these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not . <end> <end> <end>
1.5979071455820228
<start> <start> <start> wickham ' s affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia ' s for him . <end> <end> <end>
2.3646334603703862
<start> <start> <start> she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . <end> <end> <end>
1.8868239575187302
<start> <start> <start> lydia was exceedingly fond of him . <end> <end> <end>
2.0378389954560734
<start> <start> <start> he did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country . <end> <end> <end>
2.080729218096777
<start> <start> <start> you were not by , when i told mamma , and the others , all about it . <end> <end> <end>
2.452910179032955
<start> <start> <start> are not you curious to hear how it was managed ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.0240327738908497
<start> <start> <start> " no really ," replied elizabeth ; " i think there cannot be too little said on the subject ." <end> <end> <end>
2.379218204612099
<start> <start> <start> you are so strange ! <end> <end> <end>
2.276742227524781
<start> <start> <start> but i must tell you how it went off . <end> <end> <end>
2.0392484227469994
<start> <start> <start> we were married , you know , at st . clement ' s , because wickham ' s lodgings were in that parish . <end> <end> <end>
2.308976117929016
<start> <start> <start> my uncle and aunt and i were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . <end> <end> <end>
2.5128425685933737
<start> <start> <start> well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss ! <end> <end> <end>
2.6542958165948267
<start> <start> <start> i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted . <end> <end> <end>
2.036367791686001
<start> <start> <start> and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . <end> <end> <end>
1.6808543077768399
<start> <start> <start> however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham . <end> <end> <end>
2.0347302490668726
<start> <start> <start> i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . <end> <end> <end>
2.0061882884720337
<start> <start> <start> if you ' ll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight . <end> <end> <end>
1.9858584174850125
<start> <start> <start> not one party , or scheme , or any thing . <end> <end> <end>
2.011827153312064
<start> <start> <start> well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr . stone . <end> <end> <end>
1.9442068660356286
<start> <start> <start> and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . <end> <end> <end>
2.3599923873278406
<start> <start> <start> well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day . <end> <end> <end>
2.209033473434793
<start> <start> <start> but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . <end> <end> <end>
2.0275201649972794
<start> <start> <start> " mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.6952206494668327
<start> <start> <start> repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement . <end> <end> <end>
2.175799397126601
<start> <start> <start> " oh , yes !-- he was to come there with wickham , you know . <end> <end> <end>
2.0482499658736963
<start> <start> <start> but gracious me ! <end> <end> <end>
2.4111228732719314
<start> <start> <start> i quite forgot ! <end> <end> <end>
2.41614785314763
<start> <start> <start> i ought not to have said a word about it . <end> <end> <end>
2.0448278547148258
<start> <start> <start> what will wickham say ? <end> <end> <end>
2.200858521652834
<start> <start> <start> it was to be such a secret !" <end> <end> <end>
2.560088308076207
<start> <start> <start> " if it was to be secret ," said jane , " say not another word on the subject . <end> <end> <end>
2.191493339449731
<start> <start> <start> you may depend upon my seeking no further ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0033238502656054
<start> <start> <start> certainly ," said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0439154676982745
<start> <start> <start> " thank you ," said lydia , " for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry ." <end> <end> <end>
2.4268710174965435
<start> <start> <start> on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . <end> <end> <end>
1.9107905228028341
<start> <start> <start> but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . <end> <end> <end>
1.8917378762355266
<start> <start> <start> it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . <end> <end> <end>
1.6840419807226015
<start> <start> <start> conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . <end> <end> <end>
2.2812209606946867
<start> <start> <start> those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable . <end> <end> <end>
1.6607302682904757
<start> <start> <start> she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . <end> <end> <end>
1.6917509342522783
<start> <start> <start> " you may readily comprehend ," she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . <end> <end> <end>
1.7751567665332164
<start> <start> <start> pray write instantly , and let me understand it -- unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance ." <end> <end> <end>
1.7104153626062653
<start> <start> <start> " not that i _shall_ though ," she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0731954620741426
<start> <start> <start> chapter x . elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could . <end> <end> <end>
1.8986256909688513
<start> <start> <start> she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . <end> <end> <end>
1.9732471662174214
<start> <start> <start> " gracechurch - street , sept . 6 . <end> <end> <end>
1.8622233392999028
<start> <start> <start> " my dear niece , " i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you . <end> <end> <end>
1.908226969569486
<start> <start> <start> i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from _you_ . <end> <end> <end>
1.9457209093596448
<start> <start> <start> don ' t think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_ side . <end> <end> <end>
2.121949856489039
<start> <start> <start> your uncle is as much surprised as i am -- and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done . <end> <end> <end>
1.7824366898997301
<start> <start> <start> but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit . <end> <end> <end>
2.139905515449469
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . <end> <end> <end>
2.303854945831505
<start> <start> <start> it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _your ' s_ seems to have been . <end> <end> <end>
1.7167639511890214
<start> <start> <start> he came to tell mr . gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr . wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once . <end> <end> <end>
2.3878410613358563
<start> <start> <start> from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . <end> <end> <end>
1.5948264268927885
<start> <start> <start> his character was to speak for itself . <end> <end> <end>
2.0041235544852793
<start> <start> <start> he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself . <end> <end> <end>
1.9093863438014373
<start> <start> <start> if he _had another_ motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him . <end> <end> <end>
2.1742988244863097
<start> <start> <start> he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _we_ had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us . <end> <end> <end>
2.0643926441700797
<start> <start> <start> there is a lady , it seems , a mrs . younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . <end> <end> <end>
2.1046389751711136
<start> <start> <start> she then took a large house in edward - street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . <end> <end> <end>
1.7071273949372532
<start> <start> <start> she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . <end> <end> <end>
1.9340403646123765
<start> <start> <start> wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . <end> <end> <end>
2.1276615211869423
<start> <start> <start> at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished - for direction . <end> <end> <end>
1.8915299640486534
<start> <start> <start> they were in ---- street . <end> <end> <end>
2.194912962767564
<start> <start> <start> his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go . <end> <end> <end>
2.024567037049218
<start> <start> <start> but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . <end> <end> <end>
1.8752404229689275
<start> <start> <start> she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham . <end> <end> <end>
1.9696579207526164
<start> <start> <start> she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . <end> <end> <end>
2.3768572624753688
<start> <start> <start> he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . <end> <end> <end>
1.966036751635383
<start> <start> <start> he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . <end> <end> <end>
2.4736554123029615
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . <end> <end> <end>
2.10150896388065
<start> <start> <start> though mr . bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . <end> <end> <end>
2.7023959509103963
<start> <start> <start> but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . <end> <end> <end>
1.7042789353906942
<start> <start> <start> under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . <end> <end> <end>
2.3464294460807555
<start> <start> <start> they met several times , for there was much to be discussed . <end> <end> <end>
2.055444885582057
<start> <start> <start> wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . <end> <end> <end>
1.8388438452570623
<start> <start> <start> but mr . gardiner could not be seen , and mr . darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . <end> <end> <end>
2.5084528935839776
<start> <start> <start> he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former . <end> <end> <end>
1.7448299848823463
<start> <start> <start> he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . <end> <end> <end>
2.148395440643662
<start> <start> <start> on saturday he came again . <end> <end> <end>
2.146364456886299
<start> <start> <start> your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together . <end> <end> <end>
2.3296265999241275
<start> <start> <start> they met again on sunday , and then _i_ saw him too . <end> <end> <end>
2.1011209320552124
<start> <start> <start> it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn . <end> <end> <end>
1.973165083778539
<start> <start> <start> i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all . <end> <end> <end>
1.9087518277823796
<start> <start> <start> he has been accused of many faults at different times ; but _this_ is the true one . <end> <end> <end>
1.6403074098791635
<start> <start> <start> nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . <end> <end> <end>
2.111575943790696
<start> <start> <start> but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . <end> <end> <end>
1.6413219732512363
<start> <start> <start> but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most . <end> <end> <end>
1.8465774938554222
<start> <start> <start> you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people . <end> <end> <end>
2.3252594266772033
<start> <start> <start> his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_ , and his commission purchased . <end> <end> <end>
1.888267510135346
<start> <start> <start> the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above . <end> <end> <end>
2.1393073394354976
<start> <start> <start> it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . <end> <end> <end>
2.163106469672557
<start> <start> <start> perhaps there was some truth in _this_ ; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve , or _anybody ' s_ reserve , can be answerable for the event . <end> <end> <end>
1.5526498612750916
<start> <start> <start> when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . <end> <end> <end>
1.965171731056689
<start> <start> <start> i believe i have now told you every thing . <end> <end> <end>
2.110603754476246
<start> <start> <start> it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . <end> <end> <end>
1.8062876538196049
<start> <start> <start> lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house . <end> <end> <end>
1.9481856629964667
<start> <start> <start> _he_ was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane ' s letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no fresh pain . <end> <end> <end>
2.068719739069728
<start> <start> <start> i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . <end> <end> <end>
1.9135558110003943
<start> <start> <start> i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding . <end> <end> <end>
1.9682713700252086
<start> <start> <start> he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday . <end> <end> <end>
2.16547832440284
<start> <start> <start> will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him . <end> <end> <end>
1.9883768166861306
<start> <start> <start> his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire . <end> <end> <end>
1.8350532160504185
<start> <start> <start> his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _that_ , if he marry _prudently_ , his wife may teach him . <end> <end> <end>
1.614161077787447
<start> <start> <start> i thought him very sly ;-- he hardly ever mentioned your name . <end> <end> <end>
1.707914370028053
<start> <start> <start> but slyness seems the fashion . <end> <end> <end>
2.099023039476846
<start> <start> <start> pray forgive me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from p . i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park . <end> <end> <end>
1.9270530707700115
<start> <start> <start> a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . <end> <end> <end>

2.546407244524165
<start> <start> <start> the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . <end> <end> <end>
1.6639482073413405
<start> <start> <start> the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr . darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! <end> <end> <end>
1.7261178564898927
<start> <start> <start> he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . <end> <end> <end>
1.4878100733087638
<start> <start> <start> he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . <end> <end> <end>
1.9808773800552226
<start> <start> <start> her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her . <end> <end> <end>
2.405560279008526
<start> <start> <start> but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham . <end> <end> <end>
1.6554285437940424
<start> <start> <start> brother - in - law of wickham ! <end> <end> <end>
2.2817252716409833
<start> <start> <start> he had to be sure done much . <end> <end> <end>
2.5375881634954993
<start> <start> <start> she was ashamed to think how much . <end> <end> <end>
2.1073659435887673
<start> <start> <start> but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief . <end> <end> <end>
1.72310439870828
<start> <start> <start> it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . <end> <end> <end>
2.0263505275149982
<start> <start> <start> it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . <end> <end> <end>
1.8835564007427725
<start> <start> <start> how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him . <end> <end> <end>
1.6234235031734252
<start> <start> <start> for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him . <end> <end> <end>
2.128283656305356
<start> <start> <start> proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself . <end> <end> <end>
2.2004703101397305
<start> <start> <start> she read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again . <end> <end> <end>
2.05511310240431
<start> <start> <start> it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . <end> <end> <end>
2.328929651063879
<start> <start> <start> she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr . darcy and herself . <end> <end> <end>
1.6792384146169812
<start> <start> <start> " i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ?" <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> said he , as he joined her . <end> <end> <end>
2.69713031068584
<start> <start> <start> " you certainly do ," she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome ." <end> <end> <end>

2.157928689134421
<start> <start> <start> she replied in the affirmative . <end> <end> <end>
2.2957195857461663
<start> <start> <start> " i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle . <end> <end> <end>

1.9822512255931612
<start> <start> <start> " certainly ," he replied , biting his lips . <end> <end> <end>
2.0577995211166105
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said , " i was surprised to see darcy in town last month . <end> <end> <end>

1.8165022492678635
<start> <start> <start> they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good - humoured smile , " come , mr . wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it . <end> <end> <end>

2.159995399490257
<start> <start> <start> we must have mrs . long and the gouldings soon . <end> <end> <end>
2.153767988339234
<start> <start> <start> consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr . bingley in consequence of it , before _they_ did . <end> <end> <end>
2.10628234084877
<start> <start> <start> " it would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . <end> <end> <end>
2.28082933809968
<start> <start> <start> my mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much i suffer from what she says . <end> <end> <end>
2.151131608003845
<start> <start> <start> " i wish i could say any thing to comfort you ," replied elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power . <end> <end> <end>
2.0728120890820056
<start> <start> <start> you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9354033136083735
<start> <start> <start> mr . bingley arrived . <end> <end> <end>
2.6746127997709626
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could . <end> <end> <end>
2.054241892854247
<start> <start> <start> she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before . <end> <end> <end>
1.6509344249921454
<start> <start> <start> but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing - room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house . <end> <end> <end>
1.8355890543333593
<start> <start> <start> jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window -- she looked ,-- she saw mr . darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . <end> <end> <end>
2.1807022703197267
<start> <start> <start> " there is a gentleman with him , mamma ," said kitty ; " who can it be ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.0400439680258495
<start> <start> <start> " some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose ; i am sure i do not know ." <end> <end> <end>
2.9821660152749083
<start> <start> <start> " la !" <end> <end> <end>
2.6500535948235897
<start> <start> <start> replied kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> mr . what ' s his name . <end> <end> <end>
1.959346376684033
<start> <start> <start> that tall , proud man ." <end> <end> <end>
2.120407934383663
<start> <start> <start> " good gracious ! <end> <end> <end>
2.1585681439112365
<start> <start> <start> mr . <end> <end> <end>
2.6643014453175184
<start> <start> <start> darcy !-- and so it does i vow . <end> <end> <end>
1.8979532859570922
<start> <start> <start> well , any friend of mr . bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9153323971718474
<start> <start> <start> jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern . <end> <end> <end>
1.882198508971756
<start> <start> <start> she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter . <end> <end> <end>
1.7978666284292064
<start> <start> <start> both sisters were uncomfortable enough . <end> <end> <end>
2.147231465865933
<start> <start> <start> each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr . darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr . bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them . <end> <end> <end>
2.3572912260717795
<start> <start> <start> but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs . gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . <end> <end> <end>
2.080354716300447
<start> <start> <start> to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley . <end> <end> <end>
1.80499294682009
<start> <start> <start> her astonishment at his coming -- at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire . <end> <end> <end>
1.7695101389481678
<start> <start> <start> the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken . <end> <end> <end>
1.770902038229172
<start> <start> <start> but she would not be secure . <end> <end> <end>
2.674666905672778
<start> <start> <start> " let me first see how he behaves ," said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0184984041840695
<start> <start> <start> she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door . <end> <end> <end>
1.8123392764397672
<start> <start> <start> jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected . <end> <end> <end>
1.8931049616455058
<start> <start> <start> on the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . <end> <end> <end>
1.6490163226217378
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . <end> <end> <end>
1.8032512272115824
<start> <start> <start> she had ventured only one glance at darcy . <end> <end> <end>
1.8790821299103706
<start> <start> <start> but , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . <end> <end> <end>
2.351713877990238
<start> <start> <start> bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . <end> <end> <end>
1.8661218479251331
<start> <start> <start> he was received by mrs . bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend . <end> <end> <end>
1.6615150794675975
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied . <end> <end> <end>
1.5227175735230898
<start> <start> <start> darcy , after enquiring of her how mr . and mrs . gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing . <end> <end> <end>
2.0794065717401784
<start> <start> <start> he was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in derbyshire . <end> <end> <end>
2.060915290001161
<start> <start> <start> but now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . <end> <end> <end>
1.5677750165279727
<start> <start> <start> more thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed . <end> <end> <end>
1.7205702781325203
<start> <start> <start> she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so . <end> <end> <end>
1.812775394678072
<start> <start> <start> " could i expect it to be otherwise !" <end> <end> <end>
2.327903303940121
<start> <start> <start> said she . <end> <end> <end>
2.280408458212114
<start> <start> <start> " yet why did he come ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.2377004151099036
<start> <start> <start> she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak . <end> <end> <end>
2.052319506490609
<start> <start> <start> she enquired after his sister , but could do no more . <end> <end> <end>
2.0774756969739863
<start> <start> <start> " it is a long time , mr . bingley , since you went away ," said mrs . bennet . <end> <end> <end>
2.3768279048834704
<start> <start> <start> he readily agreed to it . <end> <end> <end>
2.293447931852812
<start> <start> <start> " i began to be afraid you would never come back again . <end> <end> <end>
1.9371237440295257
<start> <start> <start> a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . <end> <end> <end>
1.9150994392769434
<start> <start> <start> miss lucas is married and settled . <end> <end> <end>
2.0199949980762604
<start> <start> <start> and one of my own daughters . <end> <end> <end>
2.749540344609588
<start> <start> <start> i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers . <end> <end> <end>
2.2532199553076464
<start> <start> <start> it was only said , ' lately , george wickham , esq . <end> <end> <end>
1.9475223321813222
<start> <start> <start> to miss lydia bennet ,' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . <end> <end> <end>
1.9387743731839362
<start> <start> <start> it was my brother gardiner ' s drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . <end> <end> <end>
1.9754028232542953
<start> <start> <start> did you see it ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.2748149838544713
<start> <start> <start> bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . <end> <end> <end>
2.454065410205869
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes . <end> <end> <end>
2.0041060400040784
<start> <start> <start> how mr . darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . <end> <end> <end>
3.397698632758855
<start> <start> <start> " it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married ," continued her mother , " but at the same time , mr . bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . <end> <end> <end>
2.416214588571408
<start> <start> <start> they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long . <end> <end> <end>
1.8524387012523982
<start> <start> <start> his regiment is there ; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the ---- shire , and of his being gone into the regulars . <end> <end> <end>
2.0875745227885156
<start> <start> <start> he has _some_ friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves ." <end> <end> <end>
1.717202961825262
<start> <start> <start> it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . <end> <end> <end>
2.1199272395548725
<start> <start> <start> a few weeks , he believed . <end> <end> <end>
2.2231306518089045
<start> <start> <start> " when you have killed all your own birds , mr . bingley ," said her mother , " i beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on mr . bennet ' s manor . <end> <end> <end>
2.2929923534559555
<start> <start> <start> i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0123239935986255
<start> <start> <start> at that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion . <end> <end> <end>
1.635241358689959
<start> <start> <start> " the first wish of my heart ," said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them . <end> <end> <end>
2.299693005840011
<start> <start> <start> let me never see either one or the other again !" <end> <end> <end>
1.8650747321624022
<start> <start> <start> yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re - kindled the admiration of her former lover . <end> <end> <end>
1.6058128245499188
<start> <start> <start> when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . <end> <end> <end>
1.7521747209874234
<start> <start> <start> he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty . <end> <end> <end>
2.1750445491123003
<start> <start> <start> but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . <end> <end> <end>
2.249427737426063
<start> <start> <start> when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs . bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time . <end> <end> <end>
2.1598771858258203
<start> <start> <start> i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement ." <end> <end> <end>
2.1945620166075286
<start> <start> <start> bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business . <end> <end> <end>
1.9168443284978487
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a - year . <end> <end> <end>

2.2704477686791944
<start> <start> <start> as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more . <end> <end> <end>
1.5440276677474922
<start> <start> <start> mr . darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her . <end> <end> <end>
2.198692115494812
<start> <start> <start> " why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent ," said she , " did he come at all ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.9886585279234785
<start> <start> <start> she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . <end> <end> <end>
1.7546329424302656
<start> <start> <start> " he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? <end> <end> <end>
1.9327076411607667
<start> <start> <start> if he fears me , why come hither ? <end> <end> <end>
1.958924824122293
<start> <start> <start> if he no longer cares for me , why silent ? <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> teazing , teazing , man ! <end> <end> <end>
2.164144432840821
<start> <start> <start> her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth . <end> <end> <end>
1.6750160509474465
<start> <start> <start> " now ," said she , " that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> i am glad he dines here on tuesday . <end> <end> <end>
2.0043799352004164
<start> <start> <start> " yes , very indifferent indeed ," said elizabeth , laughingly . <end> <end> <end>
2.0940539692446167
<start> <start> <start> " oh , jane , take care ." <end> <end> <end>
2.189332555279779
<start> <start> <start> " my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now ." <end> <end> <end>
2.51047656454851
<start> <start> <start> " i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever ." <end> <end> <end>
1.954936601810877
<start> <start> <start> * * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and mrs . bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived . <end> <end> <end>
2.0190093843104657
<start> <start> <start> on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time . <end> <end> <end>
2.0999607000249942
<start> <start> <start> when they repaired to the dining - room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . <end> <end> <end>
1.99441312439989
<start> <start> <start> her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself . <end> <end> <end>
1.6615005469066368
<start> <start> <start> on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided . <end> <end> <end>
1.8181849273822737
<start> <start> <start> his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . <end> <end> <end>
2.1617202727541263
<start> <start> <start> though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . <end> <end> <end>
1.7732041953386921
<start> <start> <start> it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . <end> <end> <end>
1.967475432796576
<start> <start> <start> he was on one side of her mother . <end> <end> <end>
2.481828535391778
<start> <start> <start> she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage . <end> <end> <end>
1.6379496961814148
<start> <start> <start> she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did . <end> <end> <end>
1.8355201098953018
<start> <start> <start> her mother ' s ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth ' s mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family . <end> <end> <end>
1.8865340262929158
<start> <start> <start> anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing - room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil . <end> <end> <end>
1.6008039462677428
<start> <start> <start> she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . <end> <end> <end>
1.7965418148379926
<start> <start> <start> the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! <end> <end> <end>
2.3084175160590643
<start> <start> <start> the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair . <end> <end> <end>
1.7870508751919343
<start> <start> <start> and on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " the men shan ' t come and part us , i am determined . <end> <end> <end>
2.1027717753479744
<start> <start> <start> she followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly ! <end> <end> <end>
1.6667582639263336
<start> <start> <start> " a man who has once been refused ! <end> <end> <end>

1.5530328835028886
<start> <start> <start> there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings !" <end> <end> <end>
1.9035456897224208
<start> <start> <start> she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " is your sister at pemberley still ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.283755325126824
<start> <start> <start> " yes , she will remain there till christmas ." <end> <end> <end>

2.141371946925125
<start> <start> <start> he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away . <end> <end> <end>
2.2977872831728146
<start> <start> <start> she now lost every expectation of pleasure . <end> <end> <end>
2.0029515205913215
<start> <start> <start> they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself . <end> <end> <end>

1.866383145618865
<start> <start> <start> the venison was roasted to a turn -- and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch . <end> <end> <end>
1.5193262838593056
<start> <start> <start> the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas ' s last week ; and even mr . darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least . <end> <end> <end>

2.568752337073551
<start> <start> <start> i do think mrs . long is as good a creature as ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : i like them prodigiously ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8500437135373407
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of bingley ' s behaviour to jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals . <end> <end> <end>
2.121673086971978
<start> <start> <start> " it has been a very agreeable day ," said miss bennet to elizabeth . <end> <end> <end>

1.8725058886046526
<start> <start> <start> i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . <end> <end> <end>
1.8685749390808564
<start> <start> <start> it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9030082189456223
<start> <start> <start> " you are very cruel ," said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment ." <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> a few days after this visit , mr . bingley called again , and alone . <end> <end> <end>
2.68605527607447
<start> <start> <start> he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . <end> <end> <end>
2.2423083816394014
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . <end> <end> <end>
1.9986330757573503
<start> <start> <start> he should be particularly happy at any time , & c . & c .; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . <end> <end> <end>
1.7107321342337451
<start> <start> <start> yes , he had no engagement at all for to - morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . <end> <end> <end>
2.1673269137869693
<start> <start> <start> in ran mrs . bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " my dear jane , make haste and hurry down . <end> <end> <end>
2.1781185125846227
<start> <start> <start> he is come -- mr . bingley is come .-- he is , indeed . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> make haste , make haste . <end> <end> <end>
2.4301814974847864
<start> <start> <start> here , sarah , come to miss bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . <end> <end> <end>
1.7997212356116707
<start> <start> <start> never mind miss lizzy ' s hair ." <end> <end> <end>
2.0258559165735113
<start> <start> <start> " we will be down as soon as we can ," said jane ; " but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3210568210550226
<start> <start> <start> hang kitty ! <end> <end> <end>
2.6735322474419116
<start> <start> <start> what has she to do with it ? <end> <end> <end>
2.055442109849337
<start> <start> <start> where is your sash my dear ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.1564993415016285
<start> <start> <start> but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . <end> <end> <end>
2.1125606414922156
<start> <start> <start> the same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening . <end> <end> <end>
1.9330693414796942
<start> <start> <start> after tea , mr . bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument . <end> <end> <end>
2.099582574938553
<start> <start> <start> two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs . bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them . <end> <end> <end>
1.683716830795644
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , " what is the matter mamma ? <end> <end> <end>
2.171883179994837
<start> <start> <start> what do you keep winking at me for ? <end> <end> <end>
2.161897907227786
<start> <start> <start> what am i to do ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.3175251807286052
<start> <start> <start> " nothing child , nothing . <end> <end> <end>
2.138915144629631
<start> <start> <start> i did not wink at you ." <end> <end> <end>
2.3905252269147246
<start> <start> <start> she then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , " come here , my love , i want to speak to you ," took her out of the room . <end> <end> <end>
1.7257917288018008
<start> <start> <start> in a few minutes , mrs . bennet half opened the door and called out , " lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you ." <end> <end> <end>
2.466949542223043
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was forced to go . <end> <end> <end>
2.348892206843299
<start> <start> <start> " we may as well leave them by themselves you know ;" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall . <end> <end> <end>
2.218615306968698
<start> <start> <start> " kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8281643030889736
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing - room . <end> <end> <end>
1.9012231072623815
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet ' s schemes for this day were ineffectual . <end> <end> <end>
1.9603173973398733
<start> <start> <start> bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . <end> <end> <end>
1.8619252300519045
<start> <start> <start> his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill - judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter . <end> <end> <end>
1.5518505478404914
<start> <start> <start> he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs . bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . <end> <end> <end>
1.8766495062929267
<start> <start> <start> after this day , jane said no more of her indifference . <end> <end> <end>
2.1861379185635164
<start> <start> <start> not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr . darcy returned within the stated time . <end> <end> <end>
1.7795339074043675
<start> <start> <start> seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence . <end> <end> <end>
2.1092571887271214
<start> <start> <start> bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr . bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . <end> <end> <end>
2.1208702518331815
<start> <start> <start> the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected . <end> <end> <end>
1.861673355827295
<start> <start> <start> there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him . <end> <end> <end>
1.6826039776062869
<start> <start> <start> bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening mrs . bennet ' s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter . <end> <end> <end>
2.054647912682288
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother ' s schemes . <end> <end> <end>
1.9719260281896112
<start> <start> <start> but on returning to the drawing - room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her . <end> <end> <end>
2.022561802478924
<start> <start> <start> on opening the door , she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all . <end> <end> <end>
1.6563765744962384
<start> <start> <start> _their_ situation was awkward enough ; but _her ' s_ she thought was still worse . <end> <end> <end>
1.7084376023759862
<start> <start> <start> not a syllable was uttered by either ; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . <end> <end> <end>
1.9120362575546979
<start> <start> <start> "' tis too much !" <end> <end> <end>
2.2624474858436043
<start> <start> <start> i do not deserve it . <end> <end> <end>
2.352171596662494
<start> <start> <start> why is not every body as happy ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.0903312392015714
<start> <start> <start> every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane . <end> <end> <end>
1.9407257672901215
<start> <start> <start> but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present . <end> <end> <end>
2.358923031790455
<start> <start> <start> " i must go instantly to my mother ;" she cried . <end> <end> <end>
1.7713506525629816
<start> <start> <start> " i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself . <end> <end> <end>
1.7115727909027112
<start> <start> <start> he is gone to my father already . <end> <end> <end>
2.247793787956658
<start> <start> <start> lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! <end> <end> <end>
2.030350371675514
<start> <start> <start> how shall i bear so much happiness !" <end> <end> <end>
1.953499141293781
<start> <start> <start> she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty . <end> <end> <end>
2.147412594478717
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . <end> <end> <end>
1.588953948212982
<start> <start> <start> " and this ," said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious circumspection ! <end> <end> <end>
2.340019232604808
<start> <start> <start> of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! <end> <end> <end>
2.4862158555053604
<start> <start> <start> the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end !" <end> <end> <end>
1.870704256961256
<start> <start> <start> in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose . <end> <end> <end>
1.8769482287777266
<start> <start> <start> " where is your sister ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.4683114569539963
<start> <start> <start> said he hastily , as he opened the door . <end> <end> <end>
2.418107895022672
<start> <start> <start> " with my mother up stairs . <end> <end> <end>
2.0433405764056487
<start> <start> <start> she will be down in a moment i dare say ." <end> <end> <end>
2.764006962716348
<start> <start> <start> he then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . <end> <end> <end>
1.952010980992594
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . <end> <end> <end>
1.8645071244010705
<start> <start> <start> they shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super - excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . <end> <end> <end>
1.9343888980413793
<start> <start> <start> it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of miss bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . <end> <end> <end>
1.9506284279033494
<start> <start> <start> kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon . <end> <end> <end>
1.8440577413938517
<start> <start> <start> not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " jane , i congratulate you . <end> <end> <end>
2.0922314695580155
<start> <start> <start> you will be a very happy woman ." <end> <end> <end>
2.5442301318595186
<start> <start> <start> jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . <end> <end> <end>
1.9055520196642837
<start> <start> <start> " you are a good girl ;" he replied , " and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . <end> <end> <end>
2.2524458306670727
<start> <start> <start> i have not a doubt of your doing very well together . <end> <end> <end>
1.9559163919233156
<start> <start> <start> your tempers are by no means unlike . <end> <end> <end>
2.3459828327820524
<start> <start> <start> you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income ." <end> <end> <end>
1.6830429677296999
<start> <start> <start> " i hope not so . <end> <end> <end>
2.213182472624157
<start> <start> <start> imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in _me_ ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8781145974561668
<start> <start> <start> " exceed their income ! <end> <end> <end>
2.2775185246387992
<start> <start> <start> why , he has four or five thousand a - year , and very likely more ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9665269229359033
<start> <start> <start> then addressing her daughter , " oh ! <end> <end> <end>
2.369029406363191

1.6965617901352412
<start> <start> <start> i knew how it would be . <end> <end> <end>
2.6692116949411435
<start> <start> <start> i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! <end> <end> <end>
2.3999097668230984
<start> <start> <start> i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together . <end> <end> <end>
1.9045541184826698
<start> <start> <start> he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen !" <end> <end> <end>
1.9573724912987678
<start> <start> <start> wickham , lydia , were all forgotten . <end> <end> <end>
2.232042635393199
<start> <start> <start> jane was beyond competition her favourite child . <end> <end> <end>
1.947467289604782
<start> <start> <start> at that moment , she cared for no other . <end> <end> <end>
2.0048128850228784
<start> <start> <start> her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense . <end> <end> <end>
1.8438191930335794
<start> <start> <start> mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . <end> <end> <end>
1.6584363142356646
<start> <start> <start> bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . <end> <end> <end>
1.7700540180071775
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . <end> <end> <end>
1.7543958826784536
<start> <start> <start> in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> one morning , about a week after bingley ' s engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining - room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . <end> <end> <end>
1.934592993844118
<start> <start> <start> it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . <end> <end> <end>

1.6157086471945064
<start> <start> <start> as it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery . <end> <end> <end>
1.8103498914749776
<start> <start> <start> they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered . <end> <end> <end>

1.9400720234719302
<start> <start> <start> she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word . <end> <end> <end>
1.846761506351314
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made . <end> <end> <end>

1.7625104548713586
<start> <start> <start> mrs . bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to elizabeth , " miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn . <end> <end> <end>

2.147071213054767

2.0693524029103116
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible . <end> <end> <end>
1.6586475644980914
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr . darcy . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> it was a rational scheme to be sure ! <end> <end> <end>
2.2214667336814444
<start> <start> <start> but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley , and _her_ being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea . <end> <end> <end>
1.6172385193715895

1.9129039480603893
<start> <start> <start> and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set _that_ down , as almost certain and immediate , which _she_ had looked forward to as possible , at some future time . <end> <end> <end>
1.5203692430662383
<start> <start> <start> in revolving lady catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference . <end> <end> <end>
2.1120633404174014
<start> <start> <start> from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce . <end> <end> <end>
1.81762361143313
<start> <start> <start> if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him . <end> <end> <end>
1.70834154928265
<start> <start> <start> in that case he would return no more . <end> <end> <end>
2.0339673609990765
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way . <end> <end> <end>
1.7627559159443464
<start> <start> <start> " if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days ," she added , " i shall know how to understand it . <end> <end> <end>

1.9462311163348731
<start> <start> <start> * * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs . bennet ' s curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject . <end> <end> <end>
2.0121087844654273
<start> <start> <start> she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . <end> <end> <end>
1.9043327396701732
<start> <start> <start> it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> after a short pause , her companion added , " you are too generous to trifle with me . <end> <end> <end>
2.1689394645919045
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances . <end> <end> <end>
1.5836041998796433
<start> <start> <start> the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . <end> <end> <end>

2.1723932973988678
<start> <start> <start> she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who _did_ call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship ' s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which _she_ had refused to give . <end> <end> <end>
1.6930658754269006

1.8526751558690084

1.687980440636754
<start> <start> <start> another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . <end> <end> <end>
2.0875493574874295
<start> <start> <start> when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish . <end> <end> <end>

2.418742588758015
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . <end> <end> <end>
1.92334974202433
<start> <start> <start> she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend . <end> <end> <end>
2.0941002529128343
<start> <start> <start> but now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in lydia ' s marriage . <end> <end> <end>
2.004382502096004
<start> <start> <start> all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation . <end> <end> <end>
1.7711436273491201
<start> <start> <start> cried mrs . bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable mr . darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley ! <end> <end> <end>
2.158225269237202
<start> <start> <start> what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? <end> <end> <end>
1.918537964355914
<start> <start> <start> i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company . <end> <end> <end>
1.9078508622090733
<start> <start> <start> what shall we do with him ? <end> <end> <end>
2.1053973087572313
<start> <start> <start> lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley ' s way ." <end> <end> <end>
2.6176321433255794
<start> <start> <start> as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " mr . bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to - day ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.8779404918977456
<start> <start> <start> " i advise mr . darcy , and lizzy , and kitty ," said mrs . bennet , " to walk to oakham mount this morning . <end> <end> <end>
2.282522444509825
<start> <start> <start> " it may do very well for the others ," replied mr . bingley ; " but i am sure it will be too much for kitty . <end> <end> <end>
2.6901553403037384
<start> <start> <start> wont it , kitty ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.3467451038100315
<start> <start> <start> kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . <end> <end> <end>
2.2625566794290095
<start> <start> <start> darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented . <end> <end> <end>
1.9351660696822497
<start> <start> <start> as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs . bennet followed her , saying , " i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . <end> <end> <end>
2.153089646482309
<start> <start> <start> but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . <end> <end> <end>
2.4843613570106675
<start> <start> <start> so , do not put yourself to inconvenience ." <end> <end> <end>
2.167919896461343
<start> <start> <start> during their walk , it was resolved that mr . bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening . <end> <end> <end>
2.2743890300857497
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ' s . <end> <end> <end>
2.1566958907121605
<start> <start> <start> she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man . <end> <end> <end>
1.5429286508123634
<start> <start> <start> but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr . darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation . <end> <end> <end>
1.803007559803457
<start> <start> <start> * * * * * in the evening , soon after mr . bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr . darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . <end> <end> <end>
2.378051717302037
<start> <start> <start> she did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that _she_ , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr . darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . <end> <end> <end>
2.0407931236230654
<start> <start> <start> in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " go to your father , he wants you in the library ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8066161856909038
<start> <start> <start> her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . <end> <end> <end>
2.2656834989038037
<start> <start> <start> are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? <end> <end> <end>
2.0250163729095134
<start> <start> <start> have not you always hated him ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.0806931292027837
<start> <start> <start> how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! <end> <end> <end>
1.5991685889851053
<start> <start> <start> " or in other words , you are determined to have him . <end> <end> <end>
2.1489151682585312
<start> <start> <start> he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane . <end> <end> <end>
2.095527090913736
<start> <start> <start> but will they make you happy ?" <end> <end> <end>
2.0233450418706096
<start> <start> <start> " have you any other objection ," said elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ?" <end> <end> <end>
1.929528785273431
<start> <start> <start> " none at all . <end> <end> <end>
2.2498904415612286
<start> <start> <start> we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him ." <end> <end> <end>
1.8559685736892781
<start> <start> <start> " i do , i do like him ," she replied , with tears in her eyes , " i love him . <end> <end> <end>
2.399307375142006
<start> <start> <start> he is perfectly amiable . <end> <end> <end>
2.3792167603622536
<start> <start> <start> you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms ." <end> <end> <end>
1.9728953953609079
<start> <start> <start> he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask . <end> <end> <end>
2.217599505276551
<start> <start> <start> but let me advise you to think better of it . <end> <end> <end>
2.2377826842297006
<start> <start> <start> i know your disposition , lizzy . <end> <end> <end>
2.147135869637806
<start> <start> <start> you could scarcely escape discredit and misery . <end> <end> <end>
1.9381731230754655
<start> <start> <start> my child , let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life . <end> <end> <end>
1.730509964171589
<start> <start> <start> you know not what you are about ." <end> <end> <end>
2.2967689551023387
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr . darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match . <end> <end> <end>
1.5816327709587918
<start> <start> <start> " well , my dear ," said he , when she ceased speaking , " i have no more to say . <end> <end> <end>
2.7925239524089407
<start> <start> <start> if this be the case , he deserves you . <end> <end> <end>
2.119334923873454
<start> <start> <start> i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy ." <end> <end> <end>
2.442140204070105
<start> <start> <start> to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr . darcy had voluntarily done for lydia . <end> <end> <end>
1.9864003162064081
<start> <start> <start> he heard her with astonishment . <end> <end> <end>
2.102327984720642
<start> <start> <start> " this is an evening of wonders , indeed ! <end> <end> <end>
1.9415382741483187
<start> <start> <start> and so , darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission ! <end> <end> <end>
1.6220846094168622
<start> <start> <start> so much the better . <end> <end> <end>
2.0765141892755934
<start> <start> <start> it will save me a world of trouble and economy . <end> <end> <end>
1.7809241544732979
<start> <start> <start> had it been your uncle ' s doing , i must and _would_ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way . <end> <end> <end>
1.778258760460429
<start> <start> <start> i shall offer to pay him to - morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter ." <end> <end> <end>
1.98197347093873
<start> <start> <start> he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr . collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go -- saying , as she quitted the room , " if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure ." <end> <end> <end>
1.881948457274964
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . <end> <end> <end>
1.965440313811095
<start> <start> <start> every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time . <end> <end> <end>
1.9739987188984558
<start> <start> <start> when her mother went up to her dressing - room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . <end> <end> <end>
2.1727536903758895
<start> <start> <start> its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , mrs . bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . <end> <end> <end>
1.8191280306906819
<start> <start> <start> nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . <end> <end> <end>
1.7912570345059904
<start> <start> <start> she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> " good gracious ! <end> <end> <end>

2.108139974824092

2.1119777658981778
<start> <start> <start> this was a sad omen of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for . <end> <end> <end>
1.837391732400115
<start> <start> <start> but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs . bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . <end> <end> <end>
1.7715364980713695

2.0801959263387624
<start> <start> <start> elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley . <end> <end> <end>

1.6389362361553306

1.6861036748747538
<start> <start> <start> from the farther disadvantage of lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs . wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . <end> <end> <end>

2.027970439321721
<start> <start> <start> mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance . <end> <end> <end>

1.8768635754175218

<start> <start> <start> lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone . <end> <end> <end>
1.6028644530489453
<start> <start> <start> miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy ' s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth . <end> <end> <end>
1.5670852641285227

1.6261885095224349
<start> <start> <start> he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . <end> <end> <end>
1.7409177506046594
<start> <start> <start> by elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . <end> <end> <end>
1.7444728734116526
<start> <start> <start> lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . <end> <end> <end>
1.7335669429761553
<start> <start> <start> but at length , by elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city . <end> <end> <end>
