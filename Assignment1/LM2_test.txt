99.79115675873219
<start> <start> <start> she was wild to be at home -- to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe . <end> <end> <end>

138.40772544874562
<start> <start> <start> bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr . wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> the wedding took place ; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . <end> <end> <end>
81.67680773717268

109.77337721143644
<start> <start> <start> she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . <end> <end> <end>

<start> <start> <start> the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of lady catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . <end> <end> <end>
98.5268426541234

<start> <start> <start> wholly inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . <end> <end> <end>
